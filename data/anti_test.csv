medium_antiracist_33390,"race , education , and donald trump how american education produced the audience for a nonsense candidate our current political crisis , also known as election 2016 , where the weaknesses of the american two-party system are on flagrant display , is a perfect illustration of what happens when american education creates and reinforces a myopic , small-minded culture of exclusion . if the goal of the american education system is to create a society where critical thinkers are the minority and ethical behavior is a niche interest , then it is a booming success . all my post-baccalaureate reading and learning has brought me to the conclusion that american public education is a system built by capitalist white supremacy for the purpose of maintaining capitalist white supremacy . why on earth would i want to send my children of color to get an education like that ? people who critique education systems are very concerned with diversity in the student body and what impact it has on students , but not enough people are talking about the diversity of the curriculum . predominantly white schools , and even predominantly black and latinx schools , that use mass-produced american textbooks and curriculum guides ( from mcgraw-hill education , scholastic , houghton mifflin , harcourt , prentice hall ) have no hope of producing “ well-rounded ” students who have a strong understanding of the continuity between the past and the present . these books do not discuss the events in history that demonstrate america ’ s continuous commitment to white supremacy . they do not point out how structural racism functioned in the past or connect that to how it works today . and they make no effort to provide students with primary source material from non-white , non-male historians and historical organizations . mainstream american education is a lie of omission . schools are never going to tell students the whole truth if they are hindered by the books on their shelves and by the boards of education that provided them . what does a mainstream american curriculum look like ? it ’ s a curriculum that perpetuates the myth of the first thanksgiving and doesn ’ t draw on any primary sources from the wampanoag people who were present . it mentions the trail of tears , but fails to enumerate and illustrate the massive numbers of native americans killed by european settlers , leaving out columbus ’ own words about enslaving them written in his diary on the day he first met them . it ’ s a curriculum that will tell you the date the emancipation proclamation was signed , but leaves out all of lincoln ’ s racist rhetoric about sending african americans away to any location outside the us because he had no belief in an america where black people could live freely and equally with white people . it will tell you how mount rushmore was built and the life story of each president represented by the monument , but it won ’ t tell you about the broken treaty of laramie or about the mountain ’ s sacred significance to several native tribes . it won ’ t tell you the works progress administration slave narratives even exist in the library of congress . it won ’ t tell you what filipino americans have contributed to the united states . it won ’ t tell you how many innocent people have died due to american drone strikes since september 11 , 2001 . it won ’ t tell you how united states immigration policy has been shaped specifically around racial prejudice since the first naturalization act was ratified in 1790 . why doesn ’ t basic education tell the whole story ? what ’ s the outcome , on a national level , when all this information is left out ? the outcome is millions of americans who don ’ t know what ’ s wrong with saying and believing , “ i don ’ t see color , ” who don ’ t see the value of adding ethnic studies to schools , who don ’ t understand what affirmative action is or who benefits from it . the outcome is millions of americans who think access and opportunity are zero sum games where white people lose if people of color gain . the outcome is also millions of americans who are willing to agree with steve king and donald trump and bill o ’ reilly . millions of people wholeheartedly accept abject lies and coded language that buttress an idealized mythical america that they learned about in school — but that doesn ’ t actually exist . they believe america is a white country founded by peaceful pilgrims in the midst of an unsettled wilderness . folk tales about davey crockett , daniel boone , and paul bunyan lead them to believe america was built by the ingenuity and strength of white men . they envision american military history as a picture book of brave white soldiers defending the country against evil enemies from backward foreign lands . they believe these myths and defend them because their education has given them little reason to believe otherwise . american education functions very well to create a white american public that is defensive of “ freedom ” when dropping bombs on people in other countries , but can ’ t understand how stop-and-frisk policies violate american citizens ’ freedom . it creates a country of people who shout “ liberty ” while grilling hot dogs on memorial day — but who also suggest that black people should just comply without question when police violate their civil liberties for showing up to work , driving to see their fiancée , or smoking during a traffic stop . it functions to create and sustain an american public that is hungry and excited to hear steve king pronounce that white people are the only ones on earth who have contributed to human civilization . after reading james loewen ’ s survey of the top-selling american history textbooks in lies my teacher told me , i am ready to conclude that american public education never held it as a goal to prepare a citizenry that could easily detect and refute a bald-faced lie like that . when american children are taught the highlights of american history , the america ’ s greatest hits version of history , instead of a full , complex story of america , they miss the opportunity to see how valuable their individual contributions are to the collective movements that seek true freedom and equality for all people . they miss the chance to understand that the housing discrimination , the job discrimination , and racist immigration policies that americans of color are fighting against today are part of a centuries-long history . and they miss the chance to empathize with disenfranchised , dispossessed people because they don ’ t know the context or history of protest . instead of putting present-day struggles into historical context and explaining to students how systemic racism works , mainstream education misses the opportunity . i can not be persuaded that this is anything other than a purposeful omission . of course , the american public will react with irritation and anger , quick to label protesters as ungrateful agitators , when they have no empathy or understanding of what the protesters are fighting for . black history month , asian pacific islander american heritage month , native american heritage month , hispanic heritage month and field trips to every museum in a student ’ s city or state will never be enough to educate americans on each of these people ’ s contributions to the united states . as long as the literary canon is dominated by white male authors , americans will have a myopic view of what constitutes “ great writing. ” as long as math lessons don ’ t include the origin of the hindu-arabic numeral system , americans will not give credit to those who built the foundations of math itself . when we don ’ t discuss the pivotal roles of ( mother ) mary harris jones and larry itliong in the labor movement , americans will assume that stereotypes of women and asians must be true , since they don ’ t appear in history books . making a special month on the calendar to give a shallow recognition to a certain group of people is nothing compared to incorporating these people , their stories , and their contributions into the mainstream curriculum . this is the difference between nominal “ diversity ” efforts and actual integration . greatest hits-style education leaves americans unprepared to advocate for their own rights and makes them complicit in exploiting the rights of others . people who are taught that the fight for workers ’ rights was won when us child labor laws were implemented won ’ t ask about who , exactly , sewed the soccer ball they bought for a bargain price at walmart . they will assume everything they have was made under healthy conditions by people being paid fairly when they are not taught about what workers are fighting for in 2016 . people who think that america ’ s meat industry is all tidy and cleaned up since upton sinclair and the usda came along won ’ t question how , exactly , their ground beef got to their grocery store at such a low price . americans who are unaware of the long history of corporate abuses of people and the environment will accept capitalist politicians ’ promises that corporations will regulate themselves and that the free market will make the best decisions . and then they will be surprised when pipelines break and poison whole cities . if americans are not taught how individuals like rosa parks worked as an investigator and activist with the naacp for 11 years prior to the bus boycott flashpoint , they won ’ t follow that example . basic public education ( or private , for that matter ) does not give us this example nor does it explore all the different avenues to civic engagement . so even though we are taught the three branches of government and how a bill becomes a law , we are not taught how regular citizens can participate and organize in real , tangible ways other than voting for president . i don ’ t think this is an accidental omission . liberal and left-leaning americans of all colors watched the democratic national convention this summer without a critical eye or ear , getting carried away on buzzwords . lots of buzzwords like “ unity ” , “ freedom ” , and “ opportunity ” were floated at the dnc . but it bothered me , because watching as a black woman , i know that a black girl witnessing the nomination of hillary clinton does not have the same chances as a white girl of achieving what hillary has achieved . that ’ s a statistical reality and fact . a black , muslim , chicana , or asian girl will have to put in more effort and overcome more barriers than a white girl in order to follow in hrc ’ s footsteps . those barriers include people in positions of power ( like professors , hiring managers , and ceos ) who were educated in a patriarchal white supremacist system and who don ’ t see them as equal or fully american . and the fact that a black girl doesn ’ t have the same chances as a white girl at anything in american life means we are not unified or free or , least of all , equal . and that ’ s not what was being talked about . we need to talk about and implement a plan for how that inequality is going to be solved . meanwhile , hillary clinton was praised widely for merely mentioning the existence of systemic racism , but we need to be more explicit about the fact that because of systemic racism , black and brown girls face more hardships than white girls . we are living in inequality right now . it ’ s not a mystery where this pesky systemic racism comes from , how it works , or why it is still a problem . we don ’ t need a fact-finding commission to help identify the sources of inequality or its impact on people ’ s lives . ta-nehisi coates made it very clear in the case for reparations what structures created and perpetuate inequality . the information is already in our hands . the research has been done . but it ’ s not being taught in schools . so it does , in fact , seem like a mystery to millions of americans . what we need are elected officials who have the moral resolve to stand up to white supremacy . we need people who believe in creating truly equal access to opportunities and who understand the importance of representation to populate the seats on the boards of education . we need more regular people who demand better . people have to realize that diversity is not just different foods and festivals . diversity in education is acknowledging that the fourth thursday in november is a day of remembrance and mourning as well as a day of thankfulness . diversity in education is recognizing that susan b. anthony was a champion for women ’ s suffrage — but that she was also racist and spoke out against black voting rights . it ’ s acknowledging that americans smudge sage in their homes because their ancestors have done so for centuries , that americans observe ramadan , that americans are fifth-generation chinese and chicano families . christian-dominated , capitalist , white , cis-heteropatriarchal supremacy in america is not going to change without changing the way we teach children . if people of color are going to feel any sense of pride and if we are going to have a thorough knowledge of ourselves and our history , it ’ s not going to come from the aforementioned mainstream education . it ’ s not going to come from any institution whose stated purpose is not explicitly centered on the uplift and love of a specific non-white community . any school that does not have the explicit purpose of teaching an empowering , radically inclusive curriculum can be safely assumed to serve a pro-capitalist , pro-white supremacist purpose . you can know this is true by looking at the outrage of white parents when supplemental information about the experience of other ethnic groups is provided in schools . the state of arizona banned mexican american studies in tucson public schools in 2012 . universities from coast to coast still struggle to implement diversity goals . even montessori , waldorf and other alternative pedagogy schools that address whole child integration of mental , spiritual , emotional , and community development fail to address the fact that all this development is still happening in a racist , white supremacist environment . and children of color need their psyche and bodies protected from that . we are raising children of color ; their inner narrator needs to be attuned to their perspective and their experience . internalized racism is the guaranteed result when poc listen to the dominant , mainstream narrative without realizing where and how they are and aren ’ t being represented . parents of children of color shouldn ’ t have to choose the least-racist school from their neighborhood options . they shouldn ’ t have to choose between a racist principal but a welcoming student body at one school or a supportive principal at another school with a hostile student body . families of color have more opportunities than ever to live in wealthy school districts with robust academic programs — but why would they choose to do so when they know it ’ s an environment full of microaggressions where the curriculum won ’ t represent them ? environments like those have real and often severe mental health outcomes for students of color . what every student of color should have is an opportunity to learn in an environment that includes them . some schools are doing it — but we need many , many more . american education functions very well to create a white american public that is defensive of “ freedom ” when dropping bombs on people in other countries , but can ’ t understand how stop-and-frisk policies violate american citizens ’ freedom . greatest hits-style education leaves americans unprepared to advocate for their own rights and makes them complicit in exploiting the rights of others . so even though we are taught the three branches of government and how a bill becomes a law , we are not taught how regular citizens can participate and organize in real , tangible ways other than voting for president . i don ’ t think this is an accidental omission . it ’ s not a mystery where this pesky systemic racism comes from , how it works , or why it is still a problem … but it ’ s not being taught in schools . so it does , in fact , seem like a mystery to millions of americans . even montessori , waldorf and other alternative pedagogy schools that address whole child integration of mental , spiritual , emotional

reddit_antiracist_52853,"art can change the world ! you 're on the right track . 

 to me , the most successful political art gets you by surprise . often , it is something where the visual component is compelling enough to grab a viewer and make them take another look , but the message is n't immediately clear . it 's only when someone stops to take a closer look that your intent becomes clear . done right , that can really get to people . 

 you also have to think about who you 're trying to reach . are you trying to uplift people who are already in agreement with you ? or change the mind of someone who still does n't get the issue ? either way , it ca n't be too preachy . if you can inject a little humor ( even gallows humor ) , it can help , but that can be difficult to pull off . 

 another thing to think about is set and setting . artwork designed to be shown in a gallery is going to have a very different impact than artwork that is designed to be viewed on the street or at a protest . i happen to love public art in unexpected places . consider how you can do art that surprises people who are not in a place where they might expect to find art . 

 here are a few pieces and artists that i have seen over the years that might inspire you . 

 * got ta start with   arguably the most successful political artist of our time . 

 * nobody fucks with the establishment and makes people think like ai weiwei . his [ backpack   is probably the darkest , saddest "" fuck you "" i 've ever seen . 

 * mitchel ahern is a friend of mine . he 's not a big name but he makes amazing letterpress art . his   postcard series is one of my favorite pieces of protest art recently . he 's selling letterpressed postcards asking trump to resign , with a space for you to say why you think he should resign , already stamped . 

 *   is another friend of mine who is a very talented painter . she is doing portraits of people who have been murdered by the police . so far she has just been posting them to facebook , but i imagine she will eventually do something like sell them and donate the proceeds , or donate the artwork to an organization . 

 * [ j.r. ] ( is another giant in the political public art realm . his stuff is understated but impactful . 

 * nick cave is best known for his "" [ sound   which were a [ direct   to the rodney king riots . his   exhibition at mass moca was one of the most provocative discussions about race to hit the art world in years . i have to imagine he is going to have something very powerful to say about our current situation . 

 * also at mas moca , jenny holzer 's [ series of large scale redacted   is one of the most chilling pieces of art i 've seen .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_85496,"agree with this article completely , i 'm afraid . honestly , reddit ( alongside youtube ) are two of the worst places to find overtly blatantly racist views . i 'm a member of a number of different social media websites , some similar to reddit in nature , and those are two of the only social media websites i 've came across where white supremacist views and overt xenophobia seem to be a majority view . 

 every time i see a racist post on reddit , it distresses me , and every time i feel compelled to stand up for what is ethically right , i feel like i 'm fighting a losing battle . no matter what my response is , whether i refute the opposing argument or present a good case for my own argument , i 'm aware that i will always get downvoted to oblivion . besides , there are only so many limited ways a person can argue against a conspiracy theory ; and , when people are using whatever is available to them to justify their already - racist views , there is no way you can change their mind . 

 it 's distressing and , no matter how empathetic of a person i may be , i can not see their point . i do n't understand the idea of being overly - proud of one 's ethnicity . people scaremonger through stereotypes , when it 's obviously clear they 've never spoken to anyone of the ethnicity they 're stereotyping themselves . 

 some people scaremonger about "" white genocide "" but ( despite being an obvious myth ) , in all honesty , i still would n't understand the fuss about it even if it * were * real . yes , i am white myself , but i would n't care in the slightest if i was ethnically black , or asian etc . if people breed with one another and we end up with a unity of race , then so be it . personally , i would even argue that it would be * beneficial * - as no longer would we be able to judge based on race . i honestly do n't see the kick - off regarding that . 

 this vexes me because , even in real life , many of my extended family are open racists - small - town individuals with a small - town mentality who 've never met an immigrant in their life , but believe everything that 's on the news . i 've tried for years to get to the bottom of such paranoia - why they fight a perceived problem which has never had any presence or effect on their lives - but never to any avail . they will always remain stubborn in the belief that there is a threat that could somehow endanger the country - out there , somewhere .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_30477,"influential black theories and philosophies there were many influential black leaders throughout our history . the most recognizable names include booker t. washington , w.e.b . dubois , dr. martin luther king jr. , and malcolm x . their philosophies and teachings have help shape and form the black community that we still know today . they were all different people and because of this they all had different ways of teaching what they believed black people needed to do to gain more respect and civil rights in this country . learning about malcolm x ’ s upbringing and reading stories about booker t. washington and w.e.b . dubois has allowed me to understand better what made these black leaders so different in what they taught and has also given me the chance to understand these leaders ’ teachings . booker t. washington was born on april 5th , 1856 in hale ’ s ford , virginia . he founded the tuskegee institute which is a historically black college in alabama . when jim crow laws became a major problem and lynching was at its highest , washington believed that the black community should focus on growing its economic strength and pride through self-help . washington gave a speech known as the “ atlanta compromise ” which called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship . the tuskegee institute was formed as a way to teach students in the black community to be self sufficient and opened the door for the students to also be an asset to the white community . his contemporary , w.e.b dubois at first followed along with the “ atlanta compromise ” but later set up the national association for the advancement of colored people , or the naacp , which wanted a faster approach to political change for the black community . he believed that full civil rights and political representation would be brought about by the african-american elite . malcolm x ’ s autobiography told the story of how he was a young boy and his family continued to be the victims of arson and racism that often ended up with the entire family having to keep moving houses . his father was killed when malcolm was little leaving hos mother to take care of all the children and being forced to rely on government aid . his mother was mentally ill and malcolm and all his siblings became wardens of the state and were all split up to live in different homes . he experienced at a very young age what white power was and he was tired of the black community that expected for respect and change to come so he encouraged his followers that change could not happen by just waiting and they needed to stand up for their rights and a revolution needed to happen . although these influential black leaders all wanted change for the black community in the united states , they all had different philosophies about what was best for the black community to focus on and what they though the community needed the most . they were all able to carve their place in history and it is no question they all achieved many goals but not the ultimate goal , for blacks to be treated equal . decades have passed since the last black and influential civil rights activist has passed and our country has still not been able to put an end to the racism and mistreatment of blacks and colored people in general . there is evidence of racism in virtually every corner of this country and i am tired of it . just because someone was born with more melanin in their skin than someone else does not give any person the right to make that person feel less than what they are . everyone is a human being and nobody is better than anybody else based n the pigment of their skin or the country their family comes from . it is time to stop the hate and spread the love because racism is unacceptable . more needs to be done to combat the injustices that are committed everyday on minorities . it is time for a new leader or at least enough people that believe in the same cause so that change and justice will come . “ my plan was not to teach them to work in the old way , but to show them how to make the forces of nature — air , water , steam , electricity , horse-power — assist them in their labour ” — booker t. washington on the foundation of tuskegee institute",medium_antiracist

 it ’s long but there is a lot of statistics- 
 in 2019 1,004 people were killed by police . about 24 % were african american despite making up about 13 % of the total population(1)(2 ) . about 37 % of people killed by police were white despite white people making up 76.5 % of the total population(1)(2 ) . the race of the victim is unknown for 20 % of the police killings(1)(2 ) . 
 a piece of evidence thrown around a lot is the disproportionate amount of african americans in prison . as of 2017 african americans make up about 33 % of prison inmates ( 3 ) . however , the system and many in the system are racist . this is backed up by a study finding that in 2020 african americans are 3.64 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana use despite having comparable usage rates ( 4 ) . the disparity in arrests are due to a number of factors not just individual police being racist . red lining , which happened in the early 20th century , was the dividing of neighborhoods into “ hazardous ” and “ declining ” from “ desirable ” and “ best , ” with the “ hazardous ” and “ declining ” disproportionately populated by minorities ( 5 ) . because these neighborhoods were hazardous and because segregation kept african americans poor , people did n’t invest or build in these areas(6 ) . “ as recently as 2010 , they find , differences in the level of racial segregation , homeownership rates , home values and credit scores were still apparent where these boundaries were drawn ” ( 5 ) . this only continued to keep them poor and rundown . and because of a history of poverty , african americans are much less likely to benefit from generational wealth(6 ) . structural racism keeps african americans poor and poor people commit more crime ( 7 ) . and poor people are much more prone to alcoholism , drug abuse , smoking and obesity ( 7 ) . and police are twice as likely to use force against people of color than white people(8 ) . the structural racism combined with individual police racism ( which may not be very widespread , but even a small amount is impactful ) has created a system that oppresses african americans and other people of color , and disproportionately convicts them .

medium_antiracist_23310,"i escaped from a violent level 5 prison in georgia i should not have been there . using contraband cell phones and internet search engines i built a list of about 150 hand selected people over about three month . included in the list was the wardens boss , the commissioner for the dept of corrections in ga , and other people who i thought might respond . the letter outlined how the state of georgia was trying to kill me . 30 % of the dorm i was in had been stabbed while they were in that dorm during my stay there . i was there for escape which is a felony . about 2 hours after i sent the email , the cert team tore my cell up and carried me off to the hole which was right around the corner from medical so i saw the stabbing victims from all dorms over there — every day . for the next two weeks cert team stripped me naked daily to look for a phone because calls continued to come into the prison administration . administration thought that i sent the email to only the wardens boss and i was still sending them out one at a time — so they continued to look for a phone that was already gone . finally it cause so much trouble that i was unexpectedly released . as i was leaving the prison i was threatened by administration . despite my contacting the ga parole board to ensure that they had no business with me , i spent the next year running from us marshall 's and other police . i expect them to try to kill me again if they catch me so i run . i got away several times during that year . finally i was captured — but not before jumping from a second story balcony and running down a creek and being hunted for by gang loads of police for a while . apparently there was no warrant for my arrest , so after being captured they had to give me a bond along with the only thing they had to charge me with which was failing to surrender to the arrest which is called obstruction of justice . see the official documents here , https : //brianaberle777.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/obstruction-of-injustice/ affidavit by brian aberle regarding “ obstruction of justice ” charges filed on october 5 , 2013 . on september 30 , 2013 , a group of men with guns came searching for me through a neighborhood in smyrna georgia . the group had markings of us marshalls and georgia parole officers , however georgia parole never confirmed that this was a legitimate and authorized hunt for me . this “ official looking ” group of men scared one person in the neighborhood that must have thought i was a criminal , when in fact i am not . on saturday october 5 , 2013 at about 4:00pm — i was visiting with a friend in this neighborhood to help him get a laptop setup . a fearful neighbor called the police and told them that a fugitive was in the area . smyrna police started to gather out front and i went out the back , with a quickness like i was running for my life . police were already behind the building — because they know i run — and smyrna police have never been able to catch me . in one previous escape about a month ago where i had a better head start , police hunted for me hours while i watched from the safety of a trench behind a fence that held in a dog that stopped barking at me after i was silent and motionless for a few minutes . when smyrna came stomping through all the neighbors backyards with their growling akita attack dog ( i could hear it growling ) , they figured their dog was barking at the dog behind me which they had stirred up . they were 10 feet from me , but i was only visible from people about 5 feet away . smyrna ’ s police dog is not a hound dog to humanely track humans . it is a trained attack dog that will attack people who are not police when commanded . the dog was growling audibly and on a long leash . i remember being a bunkmate to jovan jones in bartow county jail after he was attacked by the bartow police dog for getting an uninjured a crack addict who he had caught stealing from him out of his hotel room with a butter knife . jovan was in bad shape with large flesh tears — much worse than gunshot wounds . i gave the police a chance to chase me or shoot me in the back as they threatened to . i ran down a creek that no police got their feet wet in . i hid under a thick brush and could hear the police radio . the police couldn ’ t find me . i could only see bits of police movement through the brush so i knew that if i lay still they could not see me . i was wearing black and camouflage clothing . after some time , maybe 10 minutes , i heard them call for the dog on the police radio . it was too late to go up a tree without police seeing me . my would be attacker was on the way . i stood up and yelled out with my hands up . “ here i am . don ’ t shoot me. ” i was ordered to march through an impossible thicket without using my hands to push away any branches . they saw that it was an impossible order but yelled all the louder that i hurry it up and all guns were on me . i didn ’ t see a non-police witness anywhere , so they had me in the likeness of “ a dark alley. ” after a terrible bloody struggle through the briars grabbing at my clothes that i could not use my hands to free i emerged and slowly gave them hands to cuff . the police insisted that i lay face down on the rocks and dirt with my hands behind my back to be handcuffed or they would shoot me . i did as they commanded to avoid the bullet after i went so far to avoid the dog . once they had all calmed down and had me handcuffed and standing — smyrna police were decent to me . they backed the cuffs up and locked them so they were less painful . they were not pushing me in and out of cars and trying to provoke me like some police have . there was so much blood that i was taken to the hospital to wipe it all off and see that there was no serious injury . mostly just scratches . [ picture 1 and picture 2 ] i was taken back to the smyrna jail where police continued to be decent to me while awaiting my transport to cobb county jail for some unknown charge that i had a hold for . they dried my wet clothes . the cobb county intake is very cold . police wear coats or multiple shirts and long pants . it was almost as cold as the bartow county isolation cell that i was in for 3 weeks with no clothes . smyrna police dried my clothes and i was thankful for that while i waited for a typical 8+ hours in the booking freezer . during this time , i discovered that my hold was for running away from police on june 1 , 2003 . i had been charged with “ obstruction of justice ” , and therefore i had an unknown warrant from cobb county since then . nobody told me about it . this was happening on a saturday night in a large county jail with a high flow of new arrests . i was just a piece of paper in the pile , charged with 2 misdemeanors — both “ obstruction of justice ” . to my surprise , possibly by oversight , i was [ bondable for $ 9240 ] . i wanted to hurry up and do whatever was necessary to make bond as i suspected the bond would not exist in the morning when the authorities who hate me know i am in custody . with support from friends and family i was bonded out and back on the street at about 3:00am . now i have a court date . why can we set a court date for this so fast when i have been waiting so long for a new trial court date in the superior court , and for a court date for my 1983 civil suit in federal court ? the last sentence in the first paragraph of [ count one , and count two ] had notes about my parole hold dated march 13 , 2013 and the fact that us marshalls were trying to apprehend me . possibly in the busy booking department someone did not read all the fine print on my paperwork ? maybe the jail was full and they were not trying to collect misdemeanor prisoners if they could make bail ? maybe the us marshalls called off the hunt in the last day or two ? the police computers don ’ t go to sleep at 3:00am so it seems that i don ’ t have any other legitimate holds or warrants or the computer would have prevented my release . i am free if the police will honor the bond order issued by the magistrate court . this would seem to suggest that the officers/agents from the “ fugitive recovery team ” are indeed rogue agents that are acting outside the law . why won ’ t their commanding superiors at the atlanta board of pardons and paroles confirm that the team was sent by them ? https : //skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx ? resid=d7ec275e76d295cf ! 965 how can i be guilty of “ obstruction of justice ” when i obstruct injustice ? i expect any honorable judge to agree . judge frank cox is the chief magistrate judge in cobb county . i was curious what i will be dealing with . i don ’ t know judge cox . i hope he judges fairly and is not influenced by my prosecutors like judge carey nelson was . carey nelson presided over the first trial that i have been granted a new trial for . there is more than a little bit written about judge cox on the internet . http : //www.justiceforwandaspann.com/evidence.html http : //mdjonline.com/view/full_story/20854821/article-chief-magistrate-cox-urges-county-to-save-money-by-eliminating-a-state-court-seat i spoke with people in the neighborhood who told me my arrest was a loud scene of police running through their backyards and yelling . several neighbors were interrogated by the police after my arrest . after determining that one man had no involvement with me other than having his laptop setup , the police ran his name for a warrant check to see if there was some other reason they could arrest him . there was not . since it all worked out that i am free right now — with nothing but a few scratches — running was the right thing to do — every time i had to do it . i could be avoiding knife fights in prison right now . i ’ d rather be avoiding unwarranted arrest . all pictures and this document are online at : https : //skydrive.live.com/ ? cid=d7ec275e76d295cf under “ book ” open “ obstruction of injustice 2013 ” . there were witnesses to much of this , the names available upon request . mostly they are witness to orders yelled by police . one woman claims she saw the police “ beating ” me during the handcuffing and came back crying . as a person who has honestly been beaten by police — this was not a beating . in antioch california august 2002 i was fully beat by police with 40+ baton hits , close fist face hits , a flashlight , and kicks from boots . antioch police thought i was a drug dealer . this little deal in smryna georgia was just a rough arrest . they were all kind to me once the arrest was over with . that ’ s worth a lot — kindness gets a long way with me . barking orders at me generally does not work — unless i know the dogs are on the way to do as the pigs say , to stop a cat-like getaway , all loud i say , same spit every day . under penalty of perjury , i swear that this is a true and factual statement . brian aberle october 7 , 2013 ( final paragraph added on october 8 , 2013 ) journal of my 2014 georgia arrest warrant : including may 25 update may 10–2014 legally the court is stuck in a curious loophole . after a year of running from various agents trying to capture me including but not limited to : us marshalls , parole agents , rogue sheriff/gbi , correctional system administration . nobody had any legal reason to be hunting me for arrest . the court is all tangled up in its own doings . somehow the wrong police in cobb county accidently released me is the only conclusion i have for why i am not in jail or prison right now . perhaps i escaped without a run or a climb , whatever it was — i have the bond papers that declare me free , despite the bloody near capture . the court didn ’ t know what to do about me . there are no charges , only arrests and attempted arrests . the court lost me case file momentarily , but when they found it i had left the state of georgia . if i was still in georgia it is reasonable to assume they will continue to try to arrest me illegally . the judge issued a misdemeanor bench warrant for my arrest since there were no “ charges ” i was being arrested for other than escaping from officers trying to arrest me . why were they trying ? we still don ’ t know . so naturally i got out of georgia . nobody has any right to arrest me and everybody knows it . the only hope for the court is that the bondsman turns this into a felony case , which is the normal procedure for failure to appear when out on bond . some judge in cobb county georgia issued this new bench warrant . fortunately this is just a misdemeanor judge that runs the misdemeanor court . parking tickets are misdemeanors . fortunately this new warrant is a misdemeanor bench warrant . legally , police can not come kick your front door in and haul you off to prison for not paying a parking ticket . they will do that for a felony . in this case the bondsman is much more powerful than the misdemeanor judge . i am out on bond . i did violate that bond by leaving the state . however i did it for my safety against unjust incarceration . the bondsman , if he so chooses , can pay a $ 10 fee and file a felony charge for jumping out on a $ 9000+ bond . fortunately , the bondsman in this case is just an honest businessman . i have assured him that his money will be restored one way or another and hired a local lawyer that he knows . i will restore the $ 9200 that the state sole from me in the bondsman ’ s name . this fire is under control , so i am watching it burn rather than putting it out . i am in no hurry to resolve this case or the warrant for my arrest in georgia that is going to stay in georgia without me . i have two other cases in georgia that need attention before this , one in the northern district federal court and one in bartow county , where i was granted a re-trial and never got it . i moved to boulder colorado . boulder runs circles around that backwoods backwards bartow county georgia that i escaped from . i am a free citizen now — because i escaped . all my escapes are justified . see more documents related to this 2014 arrest warrant here : http : //1drv.ms/1myj2cf update 5/25/1024 — my lawyer has confirmed that my bench warrant has been dismissed , however the cobb county prosecutors are still potentially defending bartow county unless they dismiss the “ obstruction ” charges too . my position here is that i did not obstruct any legitimate and lawful arrest attempts that all stem from bartow-antioch . police defend police , and judges defend police and judges . iam free . this georgia police-judge gang has no reason to imprison me . they fail frequently but keep trying like they have a reason . the state of colorado has been a refuge to me . i am no longer being “ hunted ” , i am cleared with dmv to get a valid driver ’ s license . in bartow county , when i was in the jail booking intake area with other fresh arrests i met 4 people who were arrested because there was ¼ ounce of marijuana in the car , they were all charged with it and had to bond out individually . in colorado marijuana is not illegal — it ’ s like a different country . the laws on the periodic table of elements are not enforced by police . the justice system is the criminal . prosecute the prosecutor . all plants have a purpose and their components need not be regulated by governments , police , or churches . people can govern their own self . in bartow county a popular criminal charge is “ possession by ingestion ” which means police catch people with contraband elements in them , not on them . in antioch california police took my blood without my permission only to find no contraband elements . iam not guilty reading this history of communications that have taken place will explain the new warrant for my arrest issued in march or april of 2014 . please research this . i am currently out of custody on bond by the bonding company “ james bond ” in cartersville georgia , otherwise i would still be in a jail cell at the current moment . the whole thing kind of reminds me of that scene in the first “ pirates of the caribbean ” where johnny depp escapes from prison then hijacks the best ship and yells “ remember the day you almost caught captain jack sparrow ” note : you need to read from the bottom toward the top to read the emails in order , if you read top down you are reading the replies before the questions — both ways work for me .

court , a smyrna , georgia address . the new court date set was 3/21/14 court in judge golick ’ s courtroom . this is the court date you missed as you failed to appear on 3/21/14 . the court has a duty to notify you at the address which you provide , which it did , at the smyrna address . the day you met me in court was prior to the clerk sending out notice on 2/17/14 of the 3/21/14 date . when i gave you my card , i gave you my assistant ’ s direct phone number 770 528 8531 so you could call her directly , and not get transferred around , to find out the status of your case in case you did

arraigned . i showed up at about 8:59 . i took a seat in the crowded courtroom . upon being ushered to the center of the row and seated more closely to make room for everyone to sit — i was next to a young woman with beautifully braided hair . she was also there for “ arraignment ” . this was her 2nd appearance for “ arraignment ” , as the previous time a few months ago , the court was not prepared so they scheduled a new court date for her . this court process is called the “ dry run ” , it is especially annoying to the court attendee when they are in custody . dry runs are a form of punishment in some places . i advised her to plead “ not guilty ” and take her case to trial after hearing a bit about it and the sister/roommate involved . i was called to the front of the court by what appeared to be some court clerk . the judge had not entered the courtroom yet . i have been to court many times ( my old journals kept count — i may be past 150 appearances by now ) this seemed strange , but each court is different . judge carey nelson keeps a box of shirts in his courtroom . court attendees are forced to wear one of them if they show up to court in a shirt without a collar , as i did . i was informed by this seemingly official woman who worked behind the bench with all the attorneys and court employees that my case has not been prepared , or for some other reason that she is unaware of my case has no case number . i was excused from court . i said , “ i am out on bond . you are telling me to leave and not even going to give me a date to appear ? ” . i was told that they will mail me a court date . upon request , she gave me this card that i interpret to be a “ get out of jail free card ” . it didn ’ t come easy , and i do deserve it , so thank you , and i ’ ll take it . october 12 , 2013 and ongoing this document contains more evidence and information about this affidavit : https : //skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx ? resid=d7ec275e76d295cf ! 965 reading the above link is a prerequisite . witness dv says that 2 police did step in the creek , they were cursing about it . witness dv also says that they were cheering and laughing when they had me handcuffed . witness dv was questioned by the “ fugitive recovery team ” and shown recent photographs of me on a bicycle . he says that the pictures were taken from intersection traffic cameras . witness dn ( lives near the arrest ) was also questioned by the “ fugitive recovery team ” about where i might be staying . dn says he saw the handcuffing only because he witnessed this event from a second vantage point . he says i was not punched by any police — which is what i thought . i know i was hit in the face during the handcuffing . i believe it was rocks — even so the damage is very minor and nearly completely gone already . in antioch california police punched me in the eye , broke my nose , and left me with not only the standard two heavy black eyes from a broken nose but also eye damage that took much longer to heal . witness ty was also questioned by the “ fugitive recovery team ” on september 30 . witness ms is the resident who resides where i jumped from his 2nd story balcony during my most recent arrest . police wanted to ask him a few questions . they asked if he would cooperate and he agreed . in his house they discovered that i was there to setup a laptop . police made mention that it did not smell like marijuana , he then realized that they were investigating him and not asking questions about me as they had stated when he let them in his house . the police ran the residents name over the radio for a warrant check . one witness , is on parole , and was questioned about his recent involvement with me at the parole office . he doesn ’ t like to talk to police . he first answered them that he didn ’ t know me . they proved otherwise , and he made the connection to his memory of me . he had no idea that i was wanted on a warrant . this man was threatened that if he was found helping or hiding me it will violate his parole now that he knows i am wanted with outstanding warrants . this is all an illegal effort to get me back in prison ( or special custody ) . this is why the government is out of money and needs to be shut down . they waste money catching , prosecuting , and imprisoning citizens who have no victims , done no damage , and speak too freely . they break the laws , they circumvent policy , they cheat to prosecute . who pays all these us marshalls , and parole officers to drive around and take pictures of me ? who authorized this ? somebody

georgia , ( for escaping from a previous arrest attempt ? ) and during the event i was cutup as many police had me at gunpoint and ordered me to walk through thick patch of briars while my hands were high in the air preventing me from moving the thorns in my way , or otherwise test their threat of killing me . i was seen at the hospital , so there is some record of the event . i expected that smyrna pd was acting on a court ordered warrant , but there should have been some hold preventing my immediate release by bond after such a dramatic no knock warrant sting operation was put into play . i contacted georgia parole who didn ’ t even have an address for me in their database , and could not get any resolution to the reason or order for the arrest . fortunately , i had published a letter i wrote to georgia parole on the internet before this event ever took place trying to establish some basic understanding with parole . i asked the clerk at the records department at the smyrna police station why i was arrested . he thought it was funny that i could not remember , but i don ’ t think it is . he pulled up the police report and offered to sell it to me . i want to buy the pictures that were taken of me when i was being booked into cobb county jail . many pictures were taken and the bandages from the hospital were removed just for the photo shoot . i was told that detective wood could help me . he was not available to speak with in person although he was at his desk , but i was able to contact him by phone from the front desk on an internal phone line . i told him i was at the police station to obtain the pictures taken during my arrest . he said that only the prosecutor can release the pictures , however i have a lawyer who already asked the prosecutor for the pictures and he was unable to obtain them . detective wood then told me that he would not release the pictures to me , but only to a lawyer . it that legal ? when i asked him that he hung up the phone on me . since the case was dismissed my criminal defense lawyer has completed his job . i simply am not able to afford another lawyer . i also don ’ t need the pictures , i have pictures that were taken a few days later when i was scabbed up and still had a black eye . i will sell them to smyrna pd , but to anyone else they are free and published here : http : //1drv.ms/1sbj8x7 ( one week later ) after a week , the pictures still have not been released to me . i just received this additional court documentation today , although i was informed of it weeks ago . i don ’ t believe the hand written note about “ cause existed ” is accurate . even marcia shein questioned paroles jurisdiction considering the new trial and the failure to meet parole requirements upon release and also considering my letters to georgia parole who would not confirm their attempts to capture me further leading me to believe they were indeed unlawful attempts to arrest me . it could be the work of prison administration who has already threatened me or it is lingering pressure directly or indirectly from bartow county due to my case against sheriff millsap , for holding me naked in a suicide cell for 3 weeks . i had been researching the garmon case . brian aberle",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_38858,"this following is a letter written by tracy olson in response to a comment made by rep. mike simpson ’ s communication director nikki wallace on march 15 , 2017 at mr. simpson ’ s boise office . during the meeting with ms. wallace and boise indivisible members tracey , nancy , kristiana , rutty and lynn , comments were made that needed “ to be called out ” said tracey . the letter below is unedited and in its entirety . it clearly makes the case that addressing racism like that embodied by iowa rep. steve king in his tweet ( see below ) in all its forms seems to stop at the doors of some of the people ’ s public servants ! this is being published with permission by the authors . racism must not be condoned through a lack of response or simply given lip service when it happens . since the now infamous @ stevekingia tweet , rep. king has doubled down time and time again . dear ms. wallace , thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday . it was great to be able to share our personal stories about our healthcare experiences and to give you some of our written concerns about the repeal of the affordable care act . we look forward to meeting with you again in the future . one comment you made however , on a different topic , stuck with us all day . the comment was made in reference to nancy ’ s concern about rep. steve king ’ s tweet . you did not refute or denounce rep. king ’ s comment as being inappropriate . instead your first comment was to point out that eric holder was a black panther . the implication , at least to us in the group was that mr. holder being a black panther was the same as steve king being a white supremacist . this is bothersome on several levels . according to my research , your assertion is not true . eric holder was never a member of the black panthers . it was reported that he was a member of the student afro-american society ( saas ) when he attended columbia university . saas was implicated in several student demonstrations at the university in the 1960s ; some where students were armed . there is no valid news reports that i could locate that reported eric holder participating in these armed protests nor was a verified member of the black panthers . if you have a valid source for your comment , we ask that you share that with us . the second concern with your statement is the implication that the black panthers are on the same level as white supremacy . we find this incredibly disturbing . black panthers , as a group , formed out of frustration and anger at african americans being suppressed by white people throughout their history in the united states . it was first and foremost a liberation movement albeit a complex one . this group wanted equality in education , housing , employment and civil rights . the black panthers were militant in its ways , actively promoting and committing violence against the police . but it also did many good things for the community by establishing health clinics , food programs , youth programs , women empowerment movements , and created opportunities for jobs and housing . don ’ t misunderstand , we do not condone violence . however , we can certainly understand why this group resorted to it . the fight for equality that erupted in the 1960 ’ s thru peaceful and violent means came after years and years of suppression , segregation , injustice , inequality and discrimination . white supremacy on the other hand is about hate — hatred of groups or individuals that are viewed to be inferior to themselves . it is not about achieving equality . it is about suppressing or deterring equality on all levels . white supremacists were and continue to be the suppressors of all minority groups , but especially people of brown or black skin tone . whites in this country are blessed with privilege ( just by being born white ) and have never suffered from racial bias , discrimination or injustices on the same level or intensity as african americans have . whites historically have been the perpetrator of discrimination , not the victim . the rise of white supremacy since the election is alarming . rhetoric that was once considered completely unacceptable is now being validated by this administration . people such as steve king , richard spencer , steve bannon , steve miller and the like are feeling empowered and bold . this language , this hateful and divisive language must be condemned by members of congress . we ’ d like to hear representative simpson condemn representative king ’ s use of this language and not dismiss it as a mistake or an error of judgement . when called out by reporters , rep. king refused to apologize and defended his remarks . we would like to hear rep. simpson support his removal from any committees he serves on . it would be equally important to hear representative labrador , senator risch and senator crapo condemn such disturbing language . we would love to hear our elected officials speak to the fact that we are all human beings who may look different but want the same things and deserve to achieve it . we all deserve to live and love freely , free from harm , from hate , from violence . instead our elected officials appear either unwilling or unable to act in such a decent way . the acts of civility , bravery and decency by members of congress , acts that were once common place have disappeared , replaced by silence . silence equals complicity . and complicity , to us , is just plain unacceptable . there are times to speak up . there are times for action . this is one of those times . respectfully , tracy olsonon behalf of nancy rice , kristina priest , kristiana rutty",medium_antiracist

 it 's difficult to strike a balance with the poc in your life between wanting to be supportive and asking for help , you want to let your friends know that you support them but also acknowledge that you are part of the problem and you see that and are working on it . talk to the other white people in your life and encourage them to make active changes , too . know someone in a management position ? encourage them to implement diversity policies . encourage your employer to do the same . stand up for poc colleagues , friends , strangers when you recognise injustices at any level and confront the times that a flippant comment or thought you have might be part of a white supremacist society . most of all , do n't be afraid of speaking out because you do n't want to make mistakes , part of learning is to make mistakes and do better next time , it 's better to act and get it wrong than to do nothing at all . 

 there 's some awesome books , podcasts articles etc out there which will help you in your learnings . also , learn about black culture from a pov that is n't related to white supremacy ! black history & culture is so rich in food , fashion , music etc and it 's important for us to learn about that too without always focussing on oppression . i recommend authors like diana evans , bernadine evaristo and zadie smith who write brilliant novels from a black perspective . just finished jacqueline woodson 's red at the bone which was an awesome book about a black family in ny !",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_37689,"so i believe your heart is in the right place when you opened this dialogue , but there are a lot things to address here , that i do n’t have the time or energy to do , but i ’ll address some . 

 blackness exists as a construct ( because race is as a whole is made up construct ) , that in us history justified the enslavement , brutality , and future disenfranchisement of slaves that were shipped against their will into the us . 

 furthermore , the concept of white was also a construct that did n’t exist before the same period , because is how different european nationalities became blended together to become ‘ white ’ , when their countries have literally been at war with each other for centuries . 

 so when we identify as black people and build a movement around that , it ’s because historically , ‘ white people ’ racialized us and then used that as a tool to maintain economic and social power . 

 next , the issue of police brutality are n’t a matter of individual cops and their feelings . that ’s irrelevant . police as an institution exist to keep poor people in their places and protect the private property ( not personal property , but property that is used to extract more wealth from the working class ) . 

 because us history has been built and shaped by the slavery of africans , the genocide of the native indigenous tribes , and the stealing of land through warfare and conflict with other nations ( for instance , tx being stolen in the mexican american war ) , and the white people profited economically and actively withheld those resources from other groups of people , it would make sense that other racial groups are less economically wealthy as a whole . this is why ‘ inner cities ’ have higher rates of poc because generational wealth was stolen from them . 

 what that means is that police act as a way to keep the status quo , regardless of the morals of the people in the uniform . their place in society is to incarcerate others based on laws that have never been just or fair . police brutality is just one of many issues of having cops in any society at all , and that police offers negatively affect communities because they keep the inequality in check and stop it from being changed . 

 also , does it matter if they mean to kill them or not ? they did . their lives are n’t the ones that are lost , their families are n’t the ones that have to grieve a death , their families are n’t the ones who have to wait in fear of being arrested for existing .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_39488,"is infrastructure a tool for segregation ? november 28 , 2016 what does infrastructure mean to us ? what is a road , a bridge , a train , a car ? for many , access to transportation networks and automobiles is the difference between a job , stable income , and opportunity , or unemployment , hunger , poverty . infrastructure is not just an abstraction . it is tangible . it is made of stone and steel . a young man i had been working with in baton rouge nervously asked me for a ride to a meeting for young advocates . i agreed and as i followed the gps from my hotel downtown to the small , slanting shotgun home he was staying in ( with a friend , just for the time being , as he said ) i noticed miles of desolate road and utter darkness . it was a half hour drive and i counted just four street lamps spread far between the two points . there were no gas stations , no bodegas , no starbucks . there were no bus stops or rail stations either . this young man of nineteen had recently compiled a long list of accomplishments . he returned to his high school and graduated after a period of homelessness . he was producing a radio show with several other teens about the importance of being a community organizer , “ doing good and being good. ” he had gotten a job at a burger king and the last time we spoke , he was proud to tell me that he was applying to be the new manager . as he got into my car , we traded music recommendations . he was writing and performing his own music , and i was excited to hear it . i asked him if he wanted to save up and get some home recording gear . he was so shy when he answered , i almost didn ’ t hear him . “ i just need to get a car , asap. ” he had been walking five miles to his job at burger king , each way , every day . again , there were no buses or trains where he lived . the week before , as he was passing under an overpass , a group of men pulled a gun on him and robbed him . he was late to work . he was fired . he told his manager what had happened . the manager didn ’ t believe him because he didn ’ t file a police report . he didn ’ t file a police report because if he had , the men who had assaulted him would use the gun next the time they saw him . he said he needed a car . to myself i thought , before he even gets to point of spending hundreds of dollars he did not have on a used car , he needed a license , insurance , registration . he would need money to get these things . he needed a job to get money . he needed transportation to get a job . he was trapped in a viscous cycle and he was at the mercy of baton rouge ’ s long , dark , empty roads . with the advent of the industrial age , the railroad , and the automobile , transportation networks were built to help people move easily between the home and work , to get food , to seek medical care . we have multiple examples of how these systems have transformed geography , policy , and human lives . from early european immigrants confined to slums in order to be near work sites , to the explicit exclusion of african americans by the federal housing administration post-world war ii , to detrimental “ urban renewal ” projects that failed inner cities , to modern day issues of gentrification and re-segregation as wealthier whites move back to the cities and displace communities of color by the out-pricing and forcing out of residents . the building of wealth is tied to opportunities for and availability of high paying jobs , which is all tied to access to those jobs . access , in this case , is reliable and affordable transportation . sarah schindler sums up this point in the abstract of her report on “ architectural exclusion : ” the built environment is characterized by man-made physical features that make it difficult for certain individuals — often poor people and people of color — to access certain places . bridges were designed to be so low that buses could not pass under them in order to prevent people of color from accessing a public beach . walls , fences , and highways separate historically white neighborhoods from historically black ones . wealthy communities have declined to be served by public transit so as to make it difficult for individuals from poorer areas to access their neighborhoods ( schindler , 2015 ) . segregation , though prevalent and clearly sanctioned by government , is bad for the national psyche of course , but it is also terrible for the economy . outside of the tremendous loss of potential and productivity from millions of historically disenfranchised groups , we also face an infrastructure system that is unsustainable and in danger of causing great damage to property and human life . this will affect those on both sides of the tracks . through segregation , we also see the undercurrent of tensions rising and the more we back groups of people into a confined corner ( physically and psychologically ) as if they were monolithic animals , we can be sure to expect animosity , violence , and destruction . we have seen it before in the bushwick riots , the l.a. riots , the baltimore riots . we can not continue to enforce systems of oppression by design and by law . in many situations centered around the profitization of basic needs such as food , housing , education , and certainly transportation , we have seen that , without the protection and guidance of the federal government and without the interference of advocates holding decision makers accountable , state and local governments in conjunction with the private sector have often used policy to further embed racist systems and structures . whether or not the intentions and decisions were explicit may be argued here and there , but that does not remove the fact that we are left with the kind of vivid segregation that we can see on a map with the naked eye . president-elect , donald trump has a vision . “ transform america ’ s crumbling infrastructure into a golden opportunity , ” in order to modernize the nation ’ s operational networks and grids , create thousands of new jobs , and “ provide maximum flexibility to the states ” ( donald j. trump for president , inc. , n.d. ) . though this vision is absolutely unoriginal , infrastructure is currently ( as it tends to habitually cycle through time and recessions and campaign seasons ) top of mind for many policymakers , investors , market watchers , and steel workers . there is also momentum ; a legitimate possibility that it sees movement through congress . however , it is a deeply complicated issue that is difficult to explain past pithy soundbites . there are risks and rewards to overhauling our infrastructure . there are motivations and resistance on all sides . in my opinion , the hardest solution to come up with is how to capitalize equity and justice . as forbes ’ energy and infrastructure contributor joel moser states , “ no one will invest in the replacement of defective bridges that have no tolls , regardless of the tax abatement , unless a revenue stream is attached to those assets ” ( moser , 2016 ) . if we could convey a message of opportunity and economic stability because of , not in spite of , the power of diversity , inclusion , and justice , we could change the maps . we could rebuild the foundation for all , not just for some . unfortunately , we are a nation of habit . we have a deep history of capitalizing segregation . the practices of block-busting and redlining after world war ii and into today have shown that racism brings profit to those in power . once we had division posts , neighborhoods , and borders defined by white exodus , existing infrastructure was more than often left to decay , and new tools of segregation were built with decisive purpose . as emily badger and darla cameron describe : look at racial maps of many american cities , and stark boundaries between neighboring black and white communities frequently denote an impassable railroad or highway , or a historically uncrossable avenue . infrastructure has long played this role : reinforcing unspoken divides , walling off communities , containing their expansion , physically isolating them from schools or parks or neighbors nearby ( badger & cameron , 2015 ) . when history shows us again and again that transit services and yes , even the human rights of immigrants , and people of color are the first to be thrown onto the chopping block — when they are not seen as an investment — there is reasonable cause for alarm from advocates and economists alike . robert a. caro ’ s incredible biography the power broker , is a searing biography of powerful city planner robert moses , the “ master builder ” of new york , a man who can wholly embody the foibles of infrastructure as a tool for segregation . reading an article that caro wrote reflecting on his work after 40 years of the book ’ s publishing , and recalling a moment where moses was giving a speech in a flushing park , he writes : what ’ s happening all around us in this country , from an unnerving rise in hate crimes , to the decimation and divestment of communities of color , public schools , and bus routes ; this is nothing new and it is certainly not an accident . moses was one of the most powerful men in history . and he never once held elected office . imagine ignorant , petty , prideful men with the weight of the electorate behind them and the intention of “ rebuilding ” our infrastructure . the time for shock and awe was centuries ago , long before the advent of public transportation as we know it today , but indeed , infrastructure is a tool for segregation . it is a tool for racism . and yet , trump is slightly correct in his vision of infrastructure as an opportunity . that is was it can be , with the political will to make it so . whether we have that kind of vision or not is to be determined . did i think of the bridges he built that embodied racism in concrete ? when he opened his long island parks during the 1930s , the only way for many poor people , particularly poor people of color , to reach them was by bus , so he built bridges over his parkways too low for buses to pass . or of the “ slum clearance ” projects he built that seemingly created new slums as fast he was clearing the old , or of the public housing he placed in locations that cemented the division of new york by race and class ? did i think in that moment of the more than half a million people he dispossessed for his projects and expressways , using methods that led one observer to say that ‘ he hounded them out like cattle ’ ?",medium_antiracist

 to me what matters is the context of a whole room being amused by a racialized performance of violence . why did the students pick that ? what comment was made on these celebrities ? what was the point of view advanced ? 

 as a comedian and comedy writer , when i make a joke about a provocative topic , i make sure that the audience can understand my point of view . i want them to know who the butt of the joke is and why . to put it differently , i always want to be able to convert my jokes into a non - funny thesis statement to make sure i agree with them . 

 based on what i 've read , the skit was n't clear about any of those points . the comedy lay in the re - enactment itself . it makes no comment on violence , or the character of the individuals involved , or the assumptions the audience might make on watching it . therefore , i conclude that the point of the bit is the blackface itself . "" look at these crazy black people . "" reducing the characters involved to their race is racist .

medium_antiracist_3169,"the defeat of the “ veil of ignorance ” in previous decades , african americans were the mere representation of slaves that initiated the isolation and discrimination towards them . african americans did not have the privilege of leading a normal life as americans because they were imposed through misery due to the enslavement and mistreatment of their owners . their true suffering began with being hold hostage and set for enslavement in another country , which proliferated to the inhumane treatment of discrimination and segregation in the united states . w.e.b . du bois , the author of our spiritual strivings , analyzes on how discrimination became an epidemic to society explaining his own experience and acknowledging the fact that he was part of this negligent institution that did not recognize the inequality , “ the exchange was merry , till one girl , a tall newcomer , refused my card , — refused it peremptorily , with a glance . then it dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that i was different from the others ; or like , mayhap , in heart and life and longing , but shut out from their world by a vast veil ” ( du bois ) . how can a skin color instigate society ’ s exclusion towards a distinct feature from theirs ? social realism elaborates our understanding on the root of racial discrimination . social realism instigates knowledge and acceptance towards a society that is negligent and ignorant to social issues such as racism . despite his intellectual knowledge , du bois , confesses that he experienced this “ veil of ignorance ” that prevented him to understand that racism was inhuman and unjust . later in his life , du bois manage this idea of the veil of ignorance that interpret the social issues that we face and sometimes suffer , yet we try to evade them as if they did not exist . there is no doubt that african americans struggle and resisted as much as they could to survive through all the misery . despite all constant inhumane treatment , they never lost faith in themselves in order to never capitulate on their effort to overcome and succeed . throughout the 20th century , african americans were battling through efforts , such as boycotts , sit-ins , protests , etc. , in order to obtain their civil rights and recuperate their life that was sentence to misery for decades . they wanted to succeed among the other citizens in order to seek representation and a voice of their people among all the caucasian americans . martin luther king jr. , a leader of the civil rights movement , desired a change in the world in order for african americans to be accepted and to have liberty . the desire to end segregation and proliferate integration was the ultimate goal . king , a non-violent activist , encouraged people abide through passive methods in order to obtain their goal without instigating violence . luther was able to seek representation among the african american society and although his efforts were at times unproductive they resulted , in later years , in the liberation and the opportunity for the black community to obtain their civil rights . martin l. king jr. was able to advocate for the civil rights movement . although his efforts resulted to his death , he was able to set a voice for a community that was uncared for . there is no doubt this shift from africans to african americans was difficult and it took many decades it was obtainable . this transgression erupted behaviors and this idea that this community needed acceptance became known such as the follow excerpt mentions that , “ he would not bleach his negro soul in a flood of white americanism , for he knows that negro blood has a message for the world . he simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a negro and an american , without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows , without having the doors of opportunity closed roughly in his face. ” du bois had pride in his race and did not feel inferior to white people . african americans do not want to forget about their heritage but they wanted to become part of america to be accepted as who they are . barack obama is an example that this ideal of “ negro blood ” does not impede the success that one can have . africans stood up for their rights and even though they always wished for a life of liberty when they obtained such life , it was surreal . faith was never lost and that positive attitude resulted in their liberty and equal rights . du bois , believed that they could always do better and that one day they were going to have the equal treatment among the white community . barack obama is a symbol of the representation of success among the african american community who through blood , pain , and suffering they finally were able to integrate and were no longer inferior to the dominance of the “ white ” power .",medium_antiracist

 - if the black movements get well established leaders- then they usually end up assassinated , but that is usually only after a thorough character assassination first .   
 - if black communities arm themselves and exercise their second amendment rights to protect their first amendment rights ( like the black panthers ) , then they ’re labeled terrorists .  
 - if athletes speak up- they get silenced , even if they protest silently to begin with  
 - if a leaderless movement occurs then we wish there were a leader so that the demands and wishes of the mob could be made clear   ( i guess ignoring that the ncaap and blm websites both outline pretty much the same demands as the mlk era- stop police brutality , hold people responsible when civil rights violations occur , and root out the systemic bias that exists within the system )

 i respectfully disagree with you . freddie mercury lied about his ethnicity , and in the movie , they show how painfully ashamed of his ethnicity he was . he distanced himself from being indian , but not from being a zoroastrian , which is very prestigious . as a matter of fact , they 're the most wealthy people in india , and they have a very fair complexion .

reddit_antiracist_28078,"do n't vilify private business and the privatization of services . it can be done well or poorly . the "" private "" part is not the inherent issue . 

 certainly those of us with experience with government provided services in other countries can tell you that services provided by government can be fucked up royally , too . 

 police quotas are not always tied to feeding the prison industry . often those quotas were first created to generate local revenue . that 's the same for writing traffic violations . 

 police quotas are also used to * * constantly * * ask for police budget increases . those increases are always wrapped in fear - mongering . showing increases in arrests ( must be getting dangerous out there ) makes it easier to get a bunch of voters to approve budget increases . 

 sometimes a person on a city council will ask for "" return on investment "" of increasing police budget . they settle on wanting to see more arrests ... instead of "" better public service "" . it 's a stupid and hurtful metric to focus on , but that 's where america is at . 

 > huge efforts for privatizing postal services . 

 ups , amazon , fedex and others already have privatized delivery services . before any of these existed the usps was a laughing stock among americans . service was horrible and working conditions were so terrible that you had many postal workers resort to mass shootings . "" going postal "" was a thing . the government had a monopoly on mail delivery and they were horrible at it .

( though that his is usual demeanor ) . after his table and plate are unattended for about five minutes , a busboy clears it and wipes the table . when he sees that his plate his gone , the manager looks back and growls something to the head waiter about his plate being cleared and shoots a dirty look at the busboy . the waiter asks what he was eating and says that they ’ ll get him another plate . my son and i finish our shake and go the register to pay . we ’ ve been going to this diner for years , and though i recognize the manager he has no idea who we are and is his typical unfriendly self . me : “ how you doing ? long day i ’ ll bet . and i see you didn ’ t even get to eat lunch. ” manager : “ he ’ s an idiot . they all are . they come here . take our jobs and our money . don ’ t bother to learn our language. ” that ’ s not exactly verbatim — but “ idiot ” “ all are ” “ take our jobs ” “ take our money ” and “ don ’ t learn the language ” were all part of it . not what i expected . i mean “ idiot ” , ok , restaurant work is hard and dude was hungry and worn out . an attack on all immigrants and his entire wait staff ? long pause while i considered my response . i chose measured . me : “ you don ’ t really mean that , do you ? some of the most accomplished people i know come from spanish speaking countries . and i think your entire staff must as well . maybe you ’ re tired and you mis-spoke. ” manager : “ well . ok. marco rubio is very accomplished . the educated ones are ok . but the salvadorans . they ’ re idiots. ” what ? it ’ s november 2015 . i ’ m in washington , d.c. , upper northwest . me : “ but i know salvadoran immigrants who are also hard-working and smart people who add much more to this country than they take . you don ’ t really believe what you said , do you ? all salvadorans ? you ’ re just having a bad day ? ” ( the autobody shop i go to in silver spring was started by a salvadoran immigrant who came here with nothing 10 or 15 years ago . he apprenticed in someone else ’ s shop for three years to learn the trade , saved every penny he could and eventualy bought the shop , which he now owns and which employs half a dozen people . he ’ s the embodiment of the american dream , small business owner , married , new baby , growing business ) . i guess he realized that he shouldn ’ t have been quite so candid about his views . manager : “ well . i didn ’ t say all salvadorans . [ yeah , he did , but maybe the backtracking wasn ’ t such a bad thing ] . just that guy. ” o.k . i finished paying . left our waitress a nice tip . and we left . now , why would he let loose with this un-guarded jingoist horse shit , like i was a fellow traveller on his freight train of ignorance and hatred ? my daughter ’ s explanation : “ well , dad , you ’ re an old white dude too. ” not as old as grumpy , thank you very much . but white and old enough to remember that his grandparents and great-grandparents escaped europe , fleeing from hatred and religious persecution , and then faced some of it here too . their relatives who stayed behind weren ’ t so lucky . nativists like father coughlin ( whose picture graces this post ) said the same sorts of things about immigrants that i heard today . they were shut down then and need to be shut down now . the price we pay for casual politiacl rhetoric by public officials — regardless of political party — is the kind of casual hate that i heard while paying for my milkshake . and to my daughter ’ s point — there are plenty of old white dudes who find this sort of belief and rhetoric stupid and un-american . i ’ m one one of them . i may not be able to change this man ’ s heart , but i can certainly let him know that there are fewer fellow travelers than he thinks . and that i ’ m not one of them . * * photo credit : the united states holocaust memorial museum . http : //www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php ? moduleid=10005516 .",medium_antiracist

 privilege in america is , interpersonally , sub human scale .   [ virtually ] no one overtly chooses white over black . 

 it 's only in aggregate that there is any human scale evidence .   people have to do activist "" experiments "" to point out how racisms works .   it shows up in an article and people clap .   then they look at their own lives where the experiment has n't been done and fail to see it . 

 i 'd assume it would compare to the disbelief in germs .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_75860,"( european perspective here ) 

 pursue this further as far as you can bear and then even further . 

 i 've tutored / mentored many students and it 's not the grades you earn that you get , it 's the grades you demand . 

 look into the end result . what will happen if you have b and others have a. for many students it comes at a surprise when their grade suddenly determines something a year or 2 - 5 from when they get the grade . 

 for example , in the last year you may be given an assignment such as a thesis . it could be that there are a limited number of subjects or titles you can pick from . picking could be done by giving the highest scoring students first choice . if you did n't know this earlier on , you may have accepted a passing grade or a lower grade , thinking a few points are n't worth creating a fuss over . then you get slapped in the face with the fact that you have a worse pool of topic to pick from because someone else did make a fuss . 

 so basically , if you have a system like this in place , you will want to fight for every single fraction of a point in order to not get shitty subjects . 

 other examples include honours courses , letters of recommendation , job placements , etc . 

 this is actually the matthew effect at work .  

 wikipedia has a surprisingly good article on education inequality 

 what 's also important to keep in mind here is stereotype threat : 

 if you feel threatened by stereotyping , which is the case here , your performance may go down . 

 it 's important to lawyer up . as soon as you lawyer up , you 'll be taken seriously . if you do n't lawyer up , you 'll be seen as someone they can give a bullshit reason and make the problem go away that way . 

 from my experience , about 25 % of students get their grades adjusted through the legal system , another 25 % fail to do so but use the legal system anyway ( they lose their case ) , 10 % get their grade adjusted on request and the remaining 40 % do n't seem to care , assume it 's reality or do n't want to step on anyone 's toes and they slowly get filtered out of higher education . 

 if you do n't fight for your grades , you may end up with the matthew effect in that you end up not being considered for first picks , jobs , internships , honours courses , positions , which leads to further disadvantages down the road . 

 there is nothing extreme about demanding proof of an evaluation of yourself . it is completely understandable and commendable that a person cares about their education , their future life and ways to better themselves . if you get a b grade , you need to be able to learn what you did wrong and how to get better . you need to be able to challenge this too because it may be an incorrect assessment . 

 nuances 

 do n't call it racism just yet . schools do n't like that word . as soon as you pull the racism card they 'll want proof of it and if you ca n't say "" he called me a nigger and all these other people heard it and i have it on video "" then you basically have nothing . if you say "" we 're being graded down because he 's racist and the proof is that we 're being graded down "" , then that 's nothing . 

 the person might not be racist but biased . i do n't believe racism exists . i 've been the target of daily violent acts of racism but i 've come to believe that full blown racism is a culmination or an emergent property of stupidity . biases and fallacies that are left unchecked due to low critical thinking skills and no demand or requirement of critical thinking skills in the area , locale , field , etc . becoming a professor does not require critical thinking skills . cts in general are very confusing for beginners of cts to grasp . i 'm struggling to get co - workers to understand it . they think you 're born with it and everyone who has kids automatically thinks their kids are gifted critical thinkers because they ask "" deep questions "" and are n't sure if santa really exists . i digress ... 

 what i 'm saying is that there may be racial bias and some tendencies or downright fullblown institutional racism at work but the person in question may not consider themselves racist and may be largely unaware of their own biases and fallacies . 

 i advise you to lawyer up , see what a lawyer has to say about it . do n't go to just any lawyer . picking a lawyer is an artform itself . the usual suggestions are to get a firm with specialised lawyers and/or a capital city or big city with an airport or city with a large group of various race people who would use lawyers . for example , if you want to anglicise your name , do n't bother with a small town lawyer ( university towns tend to be smaller ) but instead find a capital city one who has done this sort of stuff before . be mindful of firms who have their lawyers attend your school in the form of students or tutors , teachers , professors . they may be biased . if you do n't have a law faculty , they may still show up for certain philosophy or economics or medicine courses to talk about legal philosophy , law and economics or what to do when you amputate the wrong leg . 

 i can keep going on about this subject for days but i 'll quit here . 

 keep going .",reddit_antiracist

 this affects race in the following way .   if a cop seizes a bmw from a white teenager from an affluent family for weed the family will higher a lawyer and fight the charge and the seizure .   if they arrest a black teenager with the same amount of weed and seize his car the family has not the assets to fight the seizure .   in addition the car 's value may no be enough to justify he legal bill to attempt to fight the seizure .   the police are then free to auction off he car and add the proceeds to the police budget .",reddit_antiracist

( hear , hear . ) but i will take it for granted that you know something about the degrading influences of slavery , and that you will not expect great things from me this evening , but simply such facts as i may be able to advance immediately in connexion with my own experience of slavery . the subject of american slavery is beginning to attract the attention — of philanthropists of all countries — it is a matter , too , to which philosophers , statesmen , and theologians , in all parts of the world , are turning their attention . it is a matter in which the people of this country especially , and of scotland and ireland , are taking the deepest interest — it is a matter in which all persons , who speak the english language , must eventually become interested . it is no longer an unintelligible or obscure question , although there is much yet to be learned . in order to [ obtain ] the proper understanding of the subject before us , allow me briefly to state the nature of the american government , and the geographical location of slavery in the united states . there are at this time 28 states , called the united states , each of which has a constitution of its own , under which constitution is convened , from year to year , what is called a local legislature — a legislature that has the power of making the local laws for that state . each state is considered ( within the limits of the constitution ) sovereign in itself , but over all the states there is a general government , under a federal constitution , which constitutes these 28 states , the united states . the general government in the congress , under the constitution , has no right to interfere with the domestic arrangements of the individual states . the general government has the power of levying taxes , providing for the general welfare , regulating commerce , declaring war , and concluding peace . there are what are called free states and slave states ; the latter are 15 in number , the former 13 . the free states are divided from the slave states by what is called mason and dixon ’ s line , running east and west . all the states south of the line are slave states . notwithstanding the general government has nothing to do with the domestic and the local civil institutions of the individual state , it becomes my duty to show that the general government does after all give support to the institution of slavery as it exists in the slave states . an attempt has been made in this country to establish the conviction that the free states of the union have nothing whatever to do with the maintenance and perpetuity of slavery in the southern states , and many persons coming from the united states have represented themselves as coming from the free states , and have shirked all responsibility in regard to slavery on this ground . now , i am here to maintain that slavery is not only a matter belonging to the states south of the line , but is an american institution — a united states institution — a system that derives its support as well from the non-slave-holding states , as they are called , as from the slave-holding states . the slave-holding states , to be sure , enjoy all the profits of slavery — the institution exists upon their soil ; but if i were going to give the exact position of the northern and southern states it would be simply this — the slave states are the slave-holding states , while the non-slave states are the slavery-upholding states . the physical power necessary to keep the slaves in bondage lies north of the line . the southern states admit their inability to hold their slaves , except through protection afforded by the northern states . the constitution makes it the duty of the northern states to return the slave if he attempts to escape , to call out the army and navy to crush the slave into subjection , if he dare make an attempt to gain his freedom . the east and the west , the north and the south , the people of massachusetts and the people of south carolina have , through their representatives , each in their own official capacity , sworn before high heaven , that the slave shall be a slave or die . so that while the free states of the american union consent to what they call the compromise of the constitution of the united states , they are responsible for the existence of slavery in the southern states . ( loud cheers . ) there are 3,000,000 of slaves , and i believe the largest estimate that has ever been made of the slave holders does not exceed 300,000 . how do you suppose 300,000 men are capable of holding 3,000,000 men in slavery ? it can not be . the slaves could by their own power crush their masters if they would , and take their freedom , or they could run away and defy their masters to bring them back . why do they not do it ? it is because the people of the united states are all pledged , bound by their oaths , bound by their citizenship in that country , to bring their whole physical power to bear against the slave if such an event should arise . ( cries of “ shame ! ” ) the slave has no hopes from the northern states , for they are in connexion with the slave states of america . every defender of the american union , of the compromise of the united states , no matter how much he may boast of his anti-slavery feeling , is , so far as his citizenship goes , a pledged enemy to the emancipation of the bondsman . i have thought it necessary to say thus much that you might see where slavery exists , and how it exists in the united states . the slave holders admit that they are incapable of retaining their slaves . “ why , ” said one man , “ we are surrounded by savages , if they could entertain the idea that immediate death would not be their portion they would re-enact the st. domingo tragedy. ” ( hear , hear . ) the same gentleman goes on to advocate the existence of the slave-holding union between the states , and the utility of the union on the ground that should it be dissolved , the slave would cross mason and dixon ’ s line , and turn round and curse his master from the other side . now what is this system of slavery ? this is the subject of my lecture this evening — what is the character of this institution ? i am about to answer the inquiry , what is american slavery ? i do this the more readily , since i have found persons in this country who have identified the term slavery with that which i think it is not , and in some instances , i have feared , in so doing have rather ( unwittingly , i know ) detracted much from the horror with which the term slavery is contemplated . it is common in this country to distinguish every bad thing by the name slavery . intemperance is slavery ( cheers ) ; to be deprived of the right to vote is slavery , says one ; to have to work hard is slavery , says another ( laughter , and loud cheers ) ; and i do not know but that if we should let them go on , they would say to eat when we are hungry , to walk when we desire to have exercise , or to minister to our necessities , or have necessities at all , is slavery . ( laughter . ) i do not wish for a moment to detract from the horror with which the evil of intemperance is contemplated ; not at all ; nor do i wish to throw the slightest obstruction in the way of any political freedom that any class of persons in this country may desire to obtain . but i am here to say that i think the term slavery is sometimes abused by identifying it with that which it is not . slavery in the united states is the granting of that power by which one man exercises and enforces a right of property in the body and soul of another . the condition of a slave is simply that of the brute beast . he is a piece of property — a marketable commodity in the language of the law , to be bought or sold at the will and caprice of the master who claims him to be his property ; he is spoken of , thought of , and treated as property . his own good , his conscience , his intellect , his affections are all set aside by the master . the will and the wishes of the master are the law of the slave . he is as much a piece of property as a horse . if he is fed , he is fed because he is property . if he is clothed , it is with a view to the increase of his value as property . whatever of comfort is necessary to him for his body or soul , that is inconsistent with his being property , is carefully wrested from him , not only by public opinion , but by the law of the country . he is carefully deprived of everything that tends in the slightest degree to detract from his value as property . he is deprived of education . god has given him an intellect — the slave holder declares it shall not be cultivated . if his moral perception leads him in a course contrary to his value as property , the slave holder declares he shall not exercise it . the marriage institution can not exist among slaves , and one-sixth of the population of democratic america is denied its privileges by the law of the land . what is to be thought of a nation boasting of its liberty , boasting of its humanity , boasting of its christianity , boasting of its love of justice and purity , and yet having within its own borders three millions of persons denied by law the right of marriage ? — what must be the condition of that people ? i need not lift up the veil by giving you any experience of my own . every one that can put two ideas together , must see the most fearful results from such a state of things as i have just mentioned . if any of these three millions find for themselves companions , and prove themselves honest , upright , virtuous persons to each other , yet in these cases — few as i am bound to confess they are — the virtuous live in constant apprehension of being torn asunder by the merciless men-stealers that claim them as their property . ( hear . ) this is american slavery — no marriage — no education — the light of the gospel shut out from the dark mind of the bondman — and he forbidden by law to learn to read . if a mother shall teach her children to read , the law in louisiana proclaims that she may be hanged by the neck . ( sensation . ) if the father attempt to give his son a knowledge of letters , he may be punished by the whip in one instance , and in another be killed , at the discretion of the court . three millions of people shut out from the light of knowledge ! it is easy for you to conceive the evil that must result from such a state of things . ( hear , hear . ) i now come to the physical evils of slavery . i do not wish to dwell at length upon these , but it seems right to speak of them , not so much to influence your minds on this question , as to let the slave holders of america know that the curtain which conceals their crimes is being lifted abroad ( loud cheers ) ; that we are opening the dark cell , and leading the people into the horrible recesses of what they are pleased to call their domestic institution . ( cheers . ) we want them to know that a knowledge of their whippings , their scourgings , their brandings , their chainings , is not confined to their plantations , but that some negro of theirs has broken loose from his chains ( loud applause ) — has burst through the dark incrustation of slavery , and is now exposing their deeds of deep damnation to the gaze of the christian people of england . ( immense cheers . ) the slave holders resort to all kinds of cruelty . if i were disposed , i have matter enough to interest you on this question for five or six evenings , but i will not dwell at length upon these cruelties . suffice it to say , that all the peculiar modes of torture that were resorted to in the west india islands , are resorted to , i believe , even more frequently , in the united states of america . starvation , the bloody whip , the chain , the gag , the thumb-screw , cat-hauling , the cat-o ’ -nine-tails , the dungeon , the bloodhound , are all in requisition to keep the slave in his condition as a slave in the united states . ( hear . ) if any one has a doubt upon this point , i would ask him to read the chapter on slavery in dickens ’ notes on america . if any man has a doubt upon it , i have here the “ testimony of a thousand witnesses , ” which i can give at any length , all going to prove the truth of my statement . the bloodhound is regularly trained in the united states , and advertisements are to be found in the southern papers of the union , from persons advertising themselves as bloodhound trainers , and offering to hunt down slaves at fifteen dollars a piece , recommending their hounds as the fleetest in the neighbourhood , never known to fail . ( much sensation . ) advertisements are from time to time inserted , stating that slaves have escaped with iron collars about their necks , with bands of iron about their feet , marked with the lash , branded with red hot irons , the initials of their master ’ s name burned into their flesh ; and the masters advertise the fact of their being thus branded with their own signature , thereby proving to the world , that , however daring it may appear to non-slave holders , such practices are not regarded [ as ] discreditable or darmg among the slave holders themselves . why , i believe if a man should brand his horse in this country , — burn the initials of his name into any of his cattle , and publish the ferocious deed here , — that the united execrations of christians in britain would descend upon him . ( cheers . ) yet , in the united states , human beings are thus branded . as whittier says — ( loud cheers . ) the slave dealer boldly publishes his infamous acts to the world . of all things that have been said of slavery to which exception has been taken by slave holders , this , the charge of cruelty , stands foremost , and yet there is no charge capable of clearer demonstration , than that of the most barbarous inhumanity on the part of the slave holders towards their slaves . and all this is necessary — it is necessary to resort to these cruelties , in order to make the slave a slave , and to keep him a slave . why , my experience all goes to prove the truth of what you will call a marvellous proposition , that the better you treat a slave , the more you destroy his value as a slave , and enhance the probability of his eluding the grasp of the slave holder ; the more kindly you treat him , the more wretched you make him , while you keep him in the condition of a slave . my experience i say , confirms the truth of this proposition . when i was treated exceedingly ill , when my back was being scourged daily , when i was kept within an inch of my life , life was all i cared for . “ spare my life , ” was my continual prayer . when i was looking for the blow about to be inflicted upon my head , i was not thinking of my liberty ; it was my life . but , as soon as the blow was not to be feared , then came the longing for liberty . ( cheers . ) if a slave has a bad master his ambition is to get a better ; when he gets a better , he aspires to have the best ; and when he gets the best , he aspires to be his own master . ( loud cheers . ) but the slave must be brutalized to keep him as a slave . the slave holder feels this necessity . i admit this necessity : if it be right to hold slaves at all , it is right to hold them in the only way in which they can be held ; and this can be done only by shutting out the light of education from their minds , and brutalizing their persons . the whip , the chain , the gag , the thumb-screw , the bloodhound , the stocks , and all the other bloody paraphernalia of the slave-system , are indispensably necessary to the relation of master and slave . ( cheers . ) the slave must be subjected to these , or he ceases to be a slave . let him know that the whip is burned , that the fetters have been turned to some useful and profitable employment , that the chain is no longer for his limbs , that the bloodhound is no longer to be put upon his track , that his master ’ s authority over him is no longer to be enforced by taking his life , and immediately he walks out from the house of bondage and asserts his freedom as a man . ( loud cheers . ) the slave holder finds it necessary to have these implements to keep the slave in bondage ; finds it necessary to be able to say , — ” unless you do so and so ; unless you do as i bid you , i will take away your life ! ” ( hear , hear . ) some of the most awful scenes of cruelty are constantly taking place in the middle states of the union . we have in those states what are called the slave-breeding states . allow me to speak plainly . ( hear , hear . ) although it is harrowing to your feelings , it is necessary that the facts of the case should be stated . we have in the united states slavebreeding states . the very state from which the minister from our courts to yours comes is one of these states ( cries of “ hear ” ) — maryland where men , women , and children are reared for the market just as horses , sheep , and swine are raised for the market . slave-rearing is there looked upon as a legitimate trade , the law sanctions it , public opinion upholds it , the church does not condemn it . ( cries of “ shame ! ” ) it goes on in all its bloody horrors sustained by the auctioneer ’ s block . if you would see the cruelties of this system , hear the following narrative : — not long since the following scene occurred . a slave woman and a slave man had united themselves as man and wife in the absence of any law to protect them as man and wife . they had lived together by the permission , not by right , of their master , and they had reared a family . the master found it expedient , and for his interest to sell them . he did not ask them their wishes in regard to the matter at all ; they were not consulted . the man and woman were brought to the auctioneer ’ s block , under the sound of the hammer . the cry was raised , “ here goes ; who bids cash ? ” think of it , a man and wife to be sold . ( hear , hear . ) the woman was placed on the auctioneer ’ s block ; her limbs , as is customary , were brutally exposed to the purchasers , who examined her with all the freedom with which they would examine a horse . there stood the husband powerless ; no right to his wife ; the master ’ s right pre-eminent . she was sold . he was next brought to the auctioneer ’ s block . his eyes followed his wife in the distance ; and he looked beseechingly , imploringly to the man that had bought his wife , to buy him also . but he was at length bid off to another person . he was about to be separated from her he loved for ever . no word of his , no work of his , could save him from this separation . he asked permission of his new master to go and take the hand of his wife at parting . it was denied him . in the agony of his soul he rushed from the man who had just bought him , that he might take a farewell of his wife ; but his way was obstructed , he was struck over the head with a loaded whip , and was held for a moment ; but his agony was too great . when he was let go , he fell a corpse at the feet of his master . ( much sensation . ) his heart was broken . such scenes are the every-day fruits of american slavery . some two years since , the hon . seth m. gates , an anti-slavery gentleman of the state of new york , a representative in the congress of the united states , told me he saw with his own eyes the following circumstance . in the national district of columbia , over which the star-spangled emblem is constantly waving , where orators are ever holding forth on the subject of american liberty , american democracy , american republicanism , there are two slave prisons . when going across a bridge leading to one of these prisons , he saw a young woman run out , bare-footed and bare-headed , and with very little clothing on . she was running with all speed to the bridge he was approaching . his eye was fixed upon her , and he stopped to see what was the matter . he had not paused long before he saw three men run out after her . he now knew what the nature of the case was , a slave escaping from her chains , a young woman , a sister , escaping from the bondage in which she had been held . she made her way to the bridge , but had not reached it , ere from the virginia side there came two slave holders . as soon as they saw them , her pursuers called out , “ stop her. ” true to their virginian instincts , they came to the rescue of their brother kidnappers — across the bridge . the poor girl now saw that there was no chance for her . it was a trying time . she knew if she went back , she must be a slave for ever , she must be dragged down to the scenes of pollution which the slave holders continually provide for most of the poor , sinking , wretched young women , whom they call their property . she formed her resolution ; and just as those who were about to take her , were going to put hands upon her , to drag her back , she leaped over the balustrades of the bridge , and down she went to rise no more . ( great sensation . ) she chose death , rather than to go back into the hands of those christian slave holders from whom she had escaped . ( hear , hear . ) can it be possible that such things as these exist in the united states ? are not these the exceptions ? are any such scenes as this general ? are no such deeds condemned by the law and denounced by public opinion ? ( cheers . ) let me read to you a few of the laws of the slaveholding states of america . i think no better exposure of slavery can be made than is made by the laws of the states in which slavery exists . i prefer reading the laws to making any statement in confirmation of what i have said myself ; for the slave holders can not object to this testimony , since it is the calm , the cool , the deliberate enactment of their wisest heads , of their most clear-sighted , their own constituted representatives . ( hear , hear . ) “ if more than 7 slaves together are found in any road without a white person , 20 lashes a piece ; for visiting a plantation without a written pass , 10 lashes ; for letting loose a boat from where it is made fast , 39 lashes for the first offence ; and for the second , shall have cut off from his head one ear . for keeping or carrying a club , 39 lashes . for having any article for sale , without a ticket from his master , 10 lashes. ” a voice . — what is the name of the book ? mr. douglass . — i read from american slavery as it is : testimony of a thousand witnesses . these are extracted from the slave laws . this publication has been before the public of the united states for the last seven years , and not a single fact or statement recorded therein has ever been called in question by a single slave holder . ( loud cheers . ) i read , therefore , with confidence . we have the testimony of the slave holders themselves . “ for travelling in any other than the most usual and accustomed road , when going alone to any place , 40 lashes . for travelling in the night without a pass , 40 lashes. ” i am afraid you do not understand the awful character of these lashes . you must bring it before your mind . a human being in a perfect state of nudity , tied hand and foot to a stake , and a strong man standing behind with a heavy whip , knotted at the end , each blow cutting into the flesh , and leaving the warm blood dripping to the feet ( sensation ) ; and for these trifles . “ for being found in another person ’ s negro-quarters , 40 lashes ; for hunting with dogs in the woods , 30 lashes ; for being on horseback without the written permission of his master , 25 lashes ; for riding or going abroad in the night , or riding horses in the day time , without leave , a slave may be whipped , cropped , or branded in the cheek with the letter r. or otherwise punished , such punishment not extending to life , or so as to render him unfit for labour. ” the laws referred to may be found by consulting brevard ’ s digest ; haywood ’ s manual ; virginia revised code ; prince ’ s digest ; missouri laws ; mississippi revised code — a person in the gallery . — will you allow me to ask a question ? the chairman . — i must beg that there may be no interruptions . mr. douglass . — it is my custom to answer questions when they are put to me . the person in the gallery . — what is the value of a good slave ? ( hissing . ) mr. douglass . — slaves vary in price in different parts of the united states . in the middle states , where they grow them for the market , they are much cheaper than in the far south . the slave trader who purchases a slave in maryland for 700 dollars , about £160 of your money , will sell him in louisiana for 1,000 dollars , or £200 . there is great speculation in this matter , and here let me state , that when the price of cotton is high so is that of the slave . i will give you an invariable rule by which to ascertain the price of human flesh in the united states . when cotton gets up in the market in england , the price of human flesh gets up in the united states . ( hear , hear . ) how much responsibility attaches to you in the use of that commodity . ( loud cheers . ) to return to my point . a man for going to visit his brethren , without the permission of his master , and in many instances he may not have that permission , his master from caprice or other reasons , may not be willing to allow it , may be caught on his way , dragged to a post , the branding iron heated , and the name of his master or the letter r branded into his cheek or on his forehead . ( sensation . ) they treat slaves thus on the principle that they must punish for light offences in order to prevent the commission of larger ones . i wish you to mark that in the single state of virginia there are 71 crimes for which a coloured man may be executed ; while there are only three of these crimes , which when committed by a white man will subject him to that punishment . ( hear , hear . ) there are many of these crimes which if the white man did not commit , he would be regarded as a scoundrel and a coward . in south maryland , there is a law to this effect : — that if a slave shall strike his master , he may be hanged , his head severed from his body , his body quartered , and his head and quarters set up in the most prominent place in the neighbourhood . ( sensation . ) if a coloured woman , in the defence of her own virtue , in defence of her own person , should shield herself from the brutal attacks of her tyrannical master , or make the slightest res~stance , she may be killed on the spot . ( loud cries of “ shame ! ” ) no law whatever will bring the guilty man to justice for the crime . but you will ask me , can these things be possible in a land professing christianity ? yes , they are so ; and this is not the worst . no , a darker feature is yet to be presented than the mere existence of these facts . i have to inform you that the religion of the southern states , at this time , is the great supporter , the greater sanctioner of the bloody atrocities to which i have referred . ( deep sensation ) . while america is printmg tracts and bibles ; sending missionaries abroad to convert the heathen ; expending her money in various ways for the promotion of the gospel in foreign lands , the slave not only lies forgotten — uncared for , but is trampled under foot by the very churches of the land . what have we in america ? why we have slavery made part of the religion of the land . yes , the pulpit there stands up as the great defender of this cursed institution , as it is called . ministers of religion come forward , and torture the hallowed pages of inspired wisdom to sanction the bloody deed ( loud cries of “ shame ! ” ) they stand forth as the foremost , the strongest defenders of this “ institution. ” as a proof of this , i need not do more than state the general fact , that slavery has existed under the droppings of the sanctuary of the south , for the last 200 years , and there has not been any war between the religion and the slavery of the south . whips , chains , gags , and thumb-screws have all lain under the droppings of the sanctuary , and instead of rusting from off the limbs of the bondman , these droppings have served to preserve them in all their strength . instead of preaching the gospel against this tyranny , rebuke , and wrong , ministers of religion have sought , by all and every means , to throw in the background whatever in the bible could be construed into opposition to slavery , and to bring forward that which they could torture into its support . ( cries of “ shame ! ” ) this i conceive to be the darkest feature of slavery , and the most difficult to attack , because it is identified with religion , and exposes those who denounce it to the charge of infidelity . yes , those with whom i have been labouring , namely , the old organization anti-slavery society of america , have been again and again stigmatized as infidels , and for what reason ? why , solely in consequence of the faithfulness of their attacks upon the slaveholding religion of the southern states , and the northern religion that sympathizes with it . ( hear , hear . ) i have found it difficult to speak on this matter without persons coming forward and saying , “ douglass , are you not afraid of injuring the cause of christ ? you do not desire to do so , we know ; but are you not undermining religion ? ” this has been said to me again and again , even since i came to this country , but i can not be induced to leave off these exposures . ( loud cheers . ) i love the religion of our blessed saviour , i love that religion that comes from above , in the “ wisdom of god , which is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be entreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality and without hypocrisy . “ ‘ a i love that religion that sends its votaries to bind up the wounds of him that has fallen among thieves . i love that religion that makes it the duty of its disciples to visit the fatherless and widow in their affliction . i love that religion that is based upon the glorious principle , of love to god and love to man ( cheers ) ; which makes its followers do unto others as they themselves would be done by . if you demand liberty to yourself , it says , grant it to your neighbours . if you claim a right to think for yourselves , it says , allow your neighbours the same right . if you claim to act for yourselves , it says , allow your neighbours the same right . it is because i love this religion that i hate the slave-holding , the woman-whipping , the mind-darkening , the soul-destroying religion that exists in the southern states of america . ( immense cheering . ) it is because i regard the one as good , and pure , and holy , that i can not but regard the other as bad , corrupt , and wicked . loving the one i must hate the other , holding to the one i must reject the other , and i , therefore , proclaim myself an infidel to the slave-holding religion of america . ( reiterated cheers . ) why , as i said in another place , to a smaller audience the other day , in answer to the question , “ mr . douglass , are there not methodist churches , baptist churches , congregational churches , episcopal churches , roman catholic churches , presbyterian churches in the united states , and in the southern states of america , and do they not have revivals of religion , accessions to their ranks from day to day , and will you tell me that these men are not followers of the meek and lowly saviour ? ” most unhesitatingly i do . revivals in religion , and revivals in the slave trade , go hand in hand together . ( cheers . ) the church and the slave prison stand next to each other ; the groans and cries of the heartbroken slave are often drowned in the pious devotions of his religious master . ( hear , hear . ) the church-going bell and the auctioneer ’ s bell chime in with each other ; the pulpit and the auctioneer ’ s block stand in the same neighbourhood ; while the blood-stained gold goes to support the pulpit , the pulpit covers the infernal business with the garb of christianity . we have men sold to build churches , women sold to support missionaries , and babies sold to buy bibles and communion services for the churches . ( loud cheers . ) a voice . — it is not true . mr. douglass . — not true ! is it not ? ( immense cheers . ) hear the following advertisement : — ” field negroes , by thomas gadsden. ” i read now from the american churches , the bulwarks of american slavery ; by an american , or by j. g. birney . this has been before the public in this country and the united states for the last six years ; not a fact nor a statement in it has been called in question . ( cheers . ) the following is taken from the charleston courier of feb. 12 , 1835 : — ” field negroes , by thomas gadsden . on tuesday , the 17th inst. , will be sold at the north of the exchange , at 10 o ’ clock , a prime gang of ten negroes , accustomed to the culture of cotton and provisions , belonging to the independent church , in christ church parish. ” ( loud cheers . ) i could read other testimony on this point , but is it necessary ? ( cries of “ no , ” and “ one more. ” ) is it required that one more be given ? you shall have another . ( loud cheers . ) a notice taken from a savannah paper will show that slaves are often bequeathed to the missionary societies . “ bryan superior court . between john j. maxwell and others , executors of ann pray , complainants , and mary sleigh and others , devisees and legatees under the will of ann pray , defendants , in equity . a bill having been filed for the distribution of the estate of the testatrix , ann pray , and it appearing that among other legacies in her will is the following : — viz. , a legacy of one fourth of certain negro slaves to the american board of commissioners for domestic ( foreign it probably should have been ) missions , for the purpose of sending the gospel to the heathen , and particularly to the indians of this continent ; it is on motion of the solicitors of the complainants ordered , that all persons claiming the said legacy do appear and answer the bill of the complainants within four months from this day . and it is ordered , that this order be published in a public gazette of the city of savannah , and in one of the gazettes of philadelphia , once a month , for four months . extract from the minutes , december 2 , 1832. ” ( cheers . ) the bequest i am in duty bound to say , was not accepted by the board . ( cheers . ) but let me tell you what would have been accepted by that board . had those slaves been sold by ann pray , and the money bequeathed to that board , the price of their blood would have gone into the treasury , and they would have quoted chalmers , cunningham , and candlish in support of the deed . ( cheers . ) not only are legacies left and slaves sold in this way to build churches , but the right is openly defended by the church . in 1836 the great methodist church in america , holding through ministers . and elders , and members , in their own church 250,000 slaves , said in their general conference in cincinnati that they had no right , no wish , no intention to interfere with the relation of master and slave as it existed in the slave states of the american union . what was this but saying to the world , we have no right , no wish , no intention to release the bondman from his chains ? the annual conference in the south took the broad ground of the right of property in man , asserting it in a resolution , proclaiming it in an address , preaching it in thanksgiving sermons , putting it forth in 4th of july orations , and even quoting scripture . i could tire your patience by reading if it were required , extracts from documents , the genuineness of which has never been called in question , showing that the right is asserted by the slave holder , to property in human beings . ( hear , hear . ) but i must hasten to another point — how are we to get rid of this system ? this is the question which mostly concerns the people of this country . there are different ways by which you may operate against slavery . first let me state how it is upheld ; it is upheld by public opinion . how is public opinion maintained ? mainly by the press and by the pulpit . how are we to get these committed on the side of freedom ? how are we to change our pro-slavery pulpit into an anti-slavery one , our pro-slavery literature to anti-slavery literature , our pro-slavery press into an anti-slavery press ? i can only point british abolitionists to the mode they adopted in their own country . here , happily for you , the pulpit was already on your side to a considerable extent , at least the dissenting pulpit . ( cheers . ) the wesleyans have retained a sufficiency of the spirit of their founder , john wesley , to declare with him , that slavery is the sum of all villainies . ( cheers . ) you had but to proclaim the sin of slavery in the people ’ s ears , and they rallied around your standard on behalf of emancipation . not so in our country . they have taken the strongest ground against us , but i am in duty bound to say that in the northern states they are fast getting into your own way . i will , however , speak of this under another head . we have had the pulpit against us . i am not here to represent one class of abolitionists , particularly , in the united states , but the cause of the slave , and the friends of the slave , at large . however , i am more interested in the religious aspect of this question than in its political aspect . there are two classes of abolitionists in the united states ; one takes the ground that slavery is the creature of the law , that it must , therefore , be proceeded against as such ; and they have formed themselves into what is called , “ the liberty party. ” there is another class — that with which i am particularly associated , and they take the ground that our energies should be devoted to the purifying of the moral sentiment of the country , by directing its energies to the purification of the church , and the exclusion of slave holders from communion with it . ( loud cheers . ) we have proceeded at once to expose the inconsistency of retaining men-stealers as members of the church of christ . our attention was more particularly turned to this , by this able collection of facts by j. g. birney , who was in this country about six years since . 16 he brought together a number of facts , showing that the american churches were the bulwarks of american slavery . finding this to be the case , we brought the denunciations of the inspired volume to bear against slave holding and slave holders ; for after all , it is with the slave holder that we have to do , and not with the system . it is easy to denounce the system ; many of the slave holders will hold up their hands to denounce the system ; the free church of scotland will denounce the system , but the brand of infamy is to be fixed upon the brow of the slave holder . ( cheers . ) here alone we can successfully meet and overthrow this system of iniquity . the abolitionists have been labouring for the last fifteen years , in season and out of season , in the midst of obloquy and reproach , in the midst of mobs and various kinds of opposition , to establish the conviction that slave holding is a sin , and that the slave holder is a sinner and ought to be treated as such . ( loud cheers . ) thanks to heaven , we have succeeded to a considerable extent in establishing this conviction in the minds of the people in the north , and to some extent in the south . our efforts have been devoted to bringing the denunciations of religion against it . in this way we have succeeded in expelling pro-slavery , and putting in their stead , anti-slavery publications . half-a-dozen faithful abolitionists in the north were found sufficient to purify a church . never was the truth of that saying in the scriptures more beautifully illustrated , that “ one should chase a thousand , and two put ten thousand to flight , ” than in the history of this movement as regards members of the church . five or six members would band together and say to the minister , “ we want you to remember the poor slave in your prayers . we hear you thank god that you live in a land of civil and religious liberty , and yet , you make no reference to the three millions who are denied the privilege of learning the name of the god that made them . we ask you to pray for the slave. ” he would say , “ no ; i can not pray for the slave , i should give offence to that rich member of my church who contributes largely to my salary . i may drive him from the church , and may be the means of destroying his soul . ( laughter . ) is it not better that i should preach such doctrines as would retain him in the church , and thereby , by enunciating great principles , be the means eventually — mark , eventually — of bringing him to a sense of his duty in this matter ? i can not mention the slave. ” but the brethren insisted upon it , growing more and more firm . in the prayer meeting they would pray for the slave . ( cheers . ) in the conference meeting they would exhort for the slave ; they would tell of his woes ; and beg their brethren to unite with them ; the consequence would be , that in a short time they must be put out of the church , or they must leave the church . often they would say to the minister , “ unless you remember the bondman we can not support you ; we must leave our pews vacant. ” one vacant pew , is all-powerful in asserting a great and glorious principle , when it is vacant in consequence of adherence to it . a few vacant seats would soon make the minister see that something must be done for the slave , and he would commit himself by opening his mouth in prayer . to be sure this is not the highest motive by which he could be influenced but this was one of the motives , and i think a legitimate one , by which the friends might operate on the man . for , after all , bread and butter has a great influence on the subject . ( laughter and cheers . ) i am convinced , however , that a great number of northern pulpits came up to this glorious work from higher motives than self-interest ; and i believe their hearts were always on the side of the slave , and their only fear was , they could not live and preach the gospel . they thought it was necessary for them to live . george bradburn , an individual whom some of you may remember was present at the world ’ s convention in 1840 , said , he was once met by a minister , who said to him , “ brother bradburn , i think you abolitionists are too severe upon us poor ministers ; we have to take a great deal ; you do not seem to remember it is necessary we should live. ” said george bradburn , in his peculiar way , “ i do not admit any such necessity . ( laughter . ) i hold that it is not necessary for any man to live unless he can live honestly. ” ( cheers . ) our proceedings with the church have had the effect of dissolving several very important connexions with the slave states . previously to this movement the slave-holding minister could come to the north and preach in our pulpits ; the northern minister could go to the south and preach in their pulpits ; the slave-holding minister of a church could come and join a northern church ; and the northern church minister could go and join the southern church . all were woven and interwoven , linked and interlinked together ; they had a common cause to maintain . now we have succeeded in making it unpopular and discreditable to hold christian fellowship with slave holders . ( cheers . ) the great methodist general conference in 1844 , came to the decision that it was at least not expedient , or rather it was inexpedient , for a bishop to hold slaves . this was a great step . ( hear , hear . ) i must dwell upon this , not , however , to reflect on our methodist brethren , but as an illustration of the state of morals in the church . a [ non ] slave-holding bishop , bishop andrews , of south carolina , married a slave-holding wife , and became the possessor of 15 slaves . at this time , the methodist church in the north , were of opinion that bishops should not hold slaves . they remonstrated with the conference to induce bishop andrews to emancipate his slaves . the conference did it in this way if they did it [ at ] all . a resolution was brought in , when the bishop was present , to the following effect : — ” whereas bishop andrews has connected himself with slavery , and has thereby injured his itinerancy as a bishop , ” — it was not , “ whereas bishop andrews has connected himself with slavery , and has thereby become guilty , or has done a great wrong ; ” — but “ has thereby injured his itinerancy as a bishop ; we therefore resolve that bishop andrews be , and he hereby is , ” — what ? — ” requested to suspend his labours as bishop till he can get rid of ” — what ? — slavery ? — ” his impediment. ” ( laughter . ) this was the name given to slavery . one might have inferred from the preamble that it was to get rid of his wife . ( laughter , and loud cheers . ) how long did it take to pass that resolution ? they remained in new york discussing this question three weeks . they had fasting and prayers ; they had various kinds of meetings . part of the slave-holding ministers remonstrated against the resolution , as an insult to the slaveholding members of the conference . the resolution , however , was passed , although it was partly recalled by subsequent action on the part of the general conference . such was the determination of the slave-holding members of that conference to adhere to the institution of slavery that they at once moved for a dissolution of fellowship with the northern anti-slavery members of that conference . it was not the northern members that came out from the slave-holding members , but the slaveholding members that came out from the northern members . ( hear , hear . ) i am glad the cessation took place ; it was our efforts in the north that made it necessary . “ coming events cast their shadows before them. ” they saw that the spirit that was manifested in 1844 , that the holding of slaves was injurious to the itinerancy of the bishop , would in 1848 , in all probability , go so far as to say that it was not only injurious to this itinerancy , but at variance with the law of god , and they have now seceded . it was to get rid of the anti-slavery men , but they took the wrong course to preserve their institution . what we want is to get the slave holders pent up by themselves ; too little distinction has been drawn between the slave holder and the antislavery man , between the pure and the base . we want to get slave-holding politics , slave-holding civility , slave-holding religion , slave-holding ministers , slave-holding bishops , slave-holding church members , slaveholding churches , and slave-holding everything , in a position where the eyes of the world can look at them , without looking through any other thing else . ( cheers . ) this we are doing . the baptists have dissolved their connexion . the free-will baptists have long done so . the covenanters have always been separated . the society of friends many years ago set an example to the world of excluding slave holders . ( loud cheers . ) we have succeeded in creating a warm and determined religious feeling against slavery . even political abolitionists are opposed to slavery on religious ground [ s ] ; although i feel that they have not been so active on religious grounds as they ought to have been , yet i would not say that they have been without religious influence in bringing forward this question . although they could not do so in their party , they have done so as individuals . gerrit smith has taken a leading part . william goodell is calling for separation from slave holders ; and a great mass of the abolitionists of new york are taking ground against the union with slave holders in a religious form . we have succeeded in divorcing slave holders from the church to a considerable extent . i fear that i am proceeding at too great a length . ( cries of “ no , no. ” ) i therefore come back hastily to what i wish you to do . the chairman here rose , and said — there is not a foot of ground in the united states where frederick douglass ’ s legal owner would not have a right to seize him . this man , as may be supposed , is highly enraged at the course he is pursuing , and this stimulates his desire to get possession of his person , and to inflict upon him the punishment which he thinks his conduct deserves . frederick douglass has left a wife and four children in america , and i wish to state that he has published a little book , entitled the narrative of frederick douglass , which may be had at the door , and by the sale of which he and his wife and children are supported . a voice . — who is his legal owner ? mr. douglass . — i ran away from thomas auld , of st. michael ’ s , talbot county , maryland , who was my legal owner . since i came to this country , i have , as our president has said , published a narrative of my experience , and i kindly sent a copy to my master . ( laughter , and cheers . ) he has become so offended with me , that he says he will not own me any longer , and , in his boundless generosity , he has transferred his legal right in my body and soul to his brother , hugh auld ( laughter ) , who now lives in baltimore , and who declares that he will have me if ever i set my foot on american soil . ( hear , hear . ) i may be asked , why i am so anxious to bring this subject before the british public — why i do not confine my efforts to the united states ? my answer is , first , that slavery is the common enemy of mankind , and all mankind should be made acquainted with its abominable character . ( cheers . ) my next answer is , that the slave is a man , and , as such , is entitled to your sympathy as a brother . ( hear , hear . ) all the feelings , all the susceptibilities , all the capacities , which you have , he has . he is a part of the human family . he has been the prey — the common prey — of christendom for the last 300 years , and it is but right , it is but just , it is but proper , that his wrongs should be known throughout the world . ( cheers . ) i have another reason for bringing this matter before the british public , and it is this , slavery is a system of wrong , so blinding to all around , so hardening to the heart , so corrupting to the morals , so deleterious to religion , so sapping to all the principles of justice in its immediate vicinity , that the community surrounding it lack the moral stamina necessary to its removal . it is a system of such gigantic evil , so strong , so overwhelming in its power , that no one nation is equal to its removal . it requires the humanity of christianity , the morality of the world , to remove it . ( cheers . ) hence i call upon the people of britain to look at this matter , and to exert the influence i am about to show they possess , for the removal of slavery from america . i can appeal to them , as strongly by their regard for the slave holder as for the slave , to labour in this cause . ( hear , hear . ) i am here because you have an influence on america that no other nation can have . you have been drawn together by the power of steam to a marvellous extent ; the distance between london and boston is now reduced to some 12 or 14 days , so that the denunciations against slavery uttered in london this week , may be heard in a fortnight in the streets of boston , and reverberating amidst the hills of massachusetts . there is nothing said here against slavery , that will not be recorded in the united states . ( hear , hear . ) i am here also , because the slave holders do not want me to be here ; they would rather that i was not here . ( cheers . ) i have adopted a maxim laid down by napoleon , never to occupy ground which the enemy would like me to occupy . the slave holders would much rather have me , if i will denounce slavery , denounce it in the northern states , where their friends and supporters are , who will stand by and mob me for denouncing it . ( cheers . ) they feel something like the man felt , when he uttered his prayer , in which he made out a most horrible case for himself , and one of his neighbours touched him and said , “ my friend , i always had the opinion of you that you have now expressed for yourself — that you are a very great sinner. ” coming from himself it was all very well , but coming from a stranger it was rather cutting . ( cheers . ) the slave holders felt that when slavery was denounced among themselves , it was not so bad , but let one of the slaves get loose , let him summon the people of britain , and make known to them the conduct of the slave holders towards their slaves , and it cuts them to the quick , and produces a sensation such as would be produced by nothing else . ( cheers . ) the power i exert now is something like the power that is exerted by the man at the end of the lever ; my influence now is just in proportion to the distance that i am from the united states . my exposure of slavery abroad will tell more upon the hearts and consciences of slave holders , than if i was attacking them in america , for almost every paper that i now receive from the united states comes teeming with statements about this fugitive negro , calling him a “ glib-tongued scoundrel ” ( laughter ) , and saying that he is running out against the institutions and people of america . i deny the charge , that i am saying a word against the institutions of america or the people as such . what i have to say is against slavery and slave holders . i feel at liberty to speak on this subject . i have on my back the marks of the lash ; i have four sisters and one brother now under the galling chain . i feel it my duty to cry aloud and spare not . ( loud cheers . ) i am not averse to having the good opinion of my fellow-creatures . i am not averse to being kindly regarded by all men , but i am bound even at the hazard of making a large class of religionists in this country hate me , oppose me , and malign me as they have done — i am bound by the prayers and tears and entreaties of three millions of kneeling bondsmen , to have no compromise with men who are in any shape or form connected with the slave holders of america . ( reiterated cheers . ) i expose slavery in this country , because to expose it is to kill it . slavery is one of those monsters of darkness to whom the light of truth is death . expose slavery , and it dies . light is to slavery what the heat of the sun is to the root of a tree , it must die under it . all the slave holder asks of me , is silence . he does not ask me to go abroad and preach in favour of slavery ; he does not ask any one to do that . he would not say that slavery is a good thing ; but the best under the circumstances . the slave holders want total darkness on the subject . they want the hatchway shut down , that the monster may crawl in his den of darkness , crushing human hopes and happiness , destroying the bondman at will , and having no one to reprove or rebuke him . slavery shrinks from the light , it hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest its deeds should be reproved . ( cheers . ) to tear off the mask from this abominable system , to expose it to the light of heaven , aye , to the heat of the sun , that it may burn and wither it out of existence , is my object in coming to this country . ( cheers . ) but i am here because certain individuals have seen fit to come to this land , to misrepresent the character of the abolitionists , misrepresent the character of the slaves , misrepresent the character of the coloured people , and have sought to turn off attention from the slave system of america . i am here to revive this attention . and to fix it on the slave holders . what would i have you then to do ? i would have the church , in the first place — methodist , baptist , congregationalist , all persuasions — to declare , in their conventions , associations , synods , conferences , or whatever be their ecclesiastical meetings , “ no christian fellowship with slave holders. ” ( loud cheers . ) i want the slave holder surrounded , as by a wall of anti-slavery fire , so that he may see the condemnation of himself and his system glaring down in letters of light . i want him to feel that he has no sympathy in england , scotland , or ireland ; that he has none in canada , none in mexico , none among the poor wild indians ; that the voice of the civilized , aye , and savage world , is against him . i would have condemnation blaze down upon him in every direction , till , stunned and overwhelmed with shame and confusion , he is compelled to let go the grasp he holds upon the persons of his victims , and restore them to their long-lost rights . ( loud cheers . ) here , then , is work for us all to do . let me say to the churches that have spoken on the subject , i thank you with my whole heart . i thank the evangelical alliance , though i would rather they had taken stronger ground , and not only have said , “ slave holders shall not be invited , ” but “ slave holders shall not be admitted. ” ( loud cheers . ) i am a great lover of music , but i never heard any music half so sweet to my ears , as the voice of our president last night at another meeting , — the temperance meeting at exeter-hall — where a motion was made to the following effect — ” that this meeting learns with pleasure the determination of the national temperance society to hold a world ’ s convention in august next. ” on that resolution , our worthy president said that the $ 50 he was to give to that society would be withheld if they admitted slave holders to that conventions ( loud cheers . ) the fact is out : it has gone careering across the atlantic , and it will fall amidst slave holders like a bombshell . i have to say to those who have spoken on the subject , that they have not only my gratitude , but the gratitude of the millions ready to perish . but i have to say to you further , although you have done much , there is much more to be done . if you have whispered truth , whisper no longer : speak as the tempest does — stronger and stronger . let your voices be heard through the press , through the pulpit , in all directions . let the atmosphere of britain be such that a slave holder may not be able to breathe it . let him feel his lungs oppressed the moment he steps on british soil . ( loud cheers . ) why should the slave holder breathe british atmosphere when it is such as it is ? ( hear , hear . ) i had heard of britain long before i got out of slavery . i had not heard of it in the eloquent strains and eloquent language of curran ; but i had heard of the great truth embodied in that eloquent sentence which proclaims that the moment a slave sets his foot on british soil his body swells beyond the measure of his chains — they burst from around him , and he stands redeemed , regenerated , disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation . ( loud cheers . ) one word about the free church of scotland . ( cheers . ) the facts ought to be stated . the free church of scotland — do you know what church that is ? i have been talking to a people who do not need any explanation on the subject ; for i have been in scotland recently . about two years ago the free church of scotland sent a deputation to the united states , composed of the rev . dr. cunningham , mr. chalmers of his city , mr. lewis of dundee , mr. fergusson , and dr. burns , for the purpose of explaining the disruption that occurred in scotland to the people of america , and of soliciting pecuniary aid to enable the free church to build churches and to pay their ministers . on reaching the united states , the deputation were very early addressed by the committee of the american and foreign anti-slavery society , beseeching them in the most christian and powerful manner not to go into the slave states and solicit aid from slave holders , not to take the price of blood to build free churches and pay free church ministers in scotland . ( hear , hear . ) the deputation did not heed this advice ; they went at the invitation of a slave holder , dr. smythe , into the slave states . they were admitted into the pulpits of slave holders ; they were welcomed to the houses of slave holders ; they enjoyed all the hospitalities and attentions that the slave holders were capable of showering upon them ; and they took the slave holders ’ money , or rather the money of which the slave holders had robbed the slaves . ( hear , hear . ) they have returned to scotland , and have deliberately attempted , and persevered in their attempt , to show that slavery in itself is not inconsistent with christian fellowship . ( cries of “ shame ! ” and hisses . ) i hear a hiss . ( “ not at you. ” ) i am used to being hissed in scotland on this subject ( laughter ) , for they do not like me to state the thing in my own language . they have undertaken to show , that neither christ nor his apostles , had any objection to slave holders being admitted to church fellowship . they have undertaken to show , that the apostle paul in sending onesimus back to philemon , sanctioned the relation of master and slave . ( hear , hear . ) their arguments on this question are vain , being quoted in the united states by the slave-holding , pro-slavery papers against the abolitionists , and against those who are separating from the slave holder . ( hear . ) now i have to bring certain charges against that deputation . i charge them , in the first place , with having struck hands in christian fellowship with men-stealers . ( cheers . ) i charge them , in the next place , with having taken the produce of human blood to build free churches , and to pay free church ministers in scotland . i charge them with having done this knowingly , ( cheers ) , they having been met by a remonstrance against such conduct by the executive committee of the american and foreign anti-slavery society . i have to charge them with going among men-stealers , with a perfect knowledge that they were such . ( cheers . ) i have to charge them with taking money that not only was stolen , but which they knew to be stolen . i have to charge them , moreover , with going into a country where they saw three millions of people deprived of every right , stripped of every privilege , driven like brutes from time into eternity in the dark , robbed of all that makes life dear , the marriage institution destroyed , men herded together like beasts , deprived of the privilege of learning to read the name of the god who made them ; and yet that deputation did not utter a word of denunciation against the man-stealer , or a word of sympathy , for these poor , outraged , long neglected people . ( loud cries of “ shame ! ” ) [ for more on this see the recent book , send the money back , by iain whyte , available in gul ] what i want the brethren of england to do is this ; to tell the free church of scotland that they have done wrong . ( immense cheers . ) christians of england ! we want you to say to the free church of scotland , the words you have just heard : — ” send back the money. ” ( cheers . ) they can never remonstrate against the slave holder while they hold on to the money ; therefore they should send it back . i want you to aid my friend , my eloquent friend , the slaves ’ friend , mr. george thompson . ( loud cheers . ) my friend mr. thompson and myself expect to leave early to-morrow for scotland ; we are going there with few of the wealthy , few of the influential to second our efforts . we believe that it is the duty of the free church of scotland to send back the money . i believe it is in our power , under god , to induce a state of feeling in scotland which will demand the sending back of that money . we now want your aid ; we want you to raise your voices and your sympathies . let us have your sympathy . write , “ send back the money. ” speak , “ send back the money. ” preach , “ send back the money. ” ( immense cheering . ) i believe that the sending back of that money to the united states , will do more to unrivet the fetters , to break the chains of the bondsman , and to hasten the day of emancipation , than years of lecturing by the most eloquent abolitionists . it would produce such an effect , that it would send slavery staggering to its grave as if struck by the voice of heaven . the truth is , the slave holders have now scarcely anywhere to lean . they leaned against the northern states — the abolitionists have removed the prop . they used to lean a good deal on their religious fellowship in england . it was once said to a person , “ you come from maryland : are you a slave holder ? ” “ yes. ” “ then you can not come in. ” ( cheers . ) the christian people of england are beginning to see the inconsistency of holding fellowship with these men , and are breaking loose from them . the united secession synod has declared unanimously , that it will no longer strike hands in christian fellowship with the men-stealers in america . ( cheers . ) the relief synod , whose meeting is now in session in edinburgh , has come to the same unanimous conclusions ( cheers . ) the evangelical alliance has said , through dr. candlish one of the free church leaders , that the slave holders ought not to be invited . i tell you slavery can not live with all these stabs . “ send back the money — send back the money. ” ( loud cheers . ) if it is not inconsistent with this meeting , allow me to do what i have done in scotland . i want to have all the children writing about the streets “ send back the money. ” i want to have all the people saying “ send back the money ; ” and in order to rivet these words in the minds of the audience , i propose that they give three cheers , not hurrahs , but say “ send back the money. ” ( the vast assembly spontaneously complied with mr. douglass ’ s request . the effect produced was indescribable . mr. douglass then sat down amid reiterated rounds of applause . ) religion bites is edited by malory nye , an academic and writer who teaches at the university of glasgow . he can be found on twitter ( @ malorynye ) and on his website , malorynye.com . he produces two podcasts : religion bites and history ’ s ink . malory nye is also the author of the books religion the basics ( 2008 ) and there shall be an independent scotland ( 2015 ) . “ what , ho ! our countrymen in chains , “ the whip on woman ’ s shrinking flesh , “ our soil yet reddening with the stains , “ caught from her scourgings warm and fresh . ”",medium_antiracist

 > after that , bennett decided to prioritize networking . he enrolled in business incubators and attended countless startup mixers . two years ago , bennett hooked andreessen horowitz to lead an investment in wonderschool . “ for some people , you do n’t have to work to get a network , ” bennett says . “ i had to force my way in . ” 

 > elliott robinson , the only black investment partner at bessemer venture partners , says he has watched other investors at his previous firms seemingly grade black founders with a different rubric . robinson says he ’s treated differently by his peers in the industry , too . investors tell him they ca n’t fathom what it would be like to have a black person on a startup ’s board , he says . “ that ’s a real conversation i have multiple times a year , ” robinson says . “ i ’ve had multiple investors say this , but i ’ll never forget the first time . ” 

 > in recent weeks , being black has become an asset for the first time in his career , robinson says . ceos and boards are calling to ask for his advice on how to respond to the social - justice movement sweeping across the globe . he tells companies to diversify their workforces and resist the urge to recruit based on whether someone is a “ cultural fit . ” the trope is often used as an excuse to discriminate . instead , robinson encourages companies to search for people who can add to the culture . 

 > hayes did n’t start lucidworks . the company was founded in 2007 by a team of white men . by 2013 , the company was struggling to find customers for its service , a search engine for retailers ’ and other businesses ’ data . lucidworks hired hayes that year from splunk inc. , a rising corporate software company , and promoted him to ceo in 2014 . 

 > his first two fundraising rounds were challenging , according to hayes and his apparent doppelgänger , messick . the recurring confusion about who was ceo , and the embarrassment and apologies that followed , certainly did n’t help . “ i usually remember the room and the look on the face , ” hayes says . “ the energy would drop dramatically . ” 

 > this sort of mixup is so common for black ceos that one woman says a group of vcs assumed one of her interns , a young white man , was the head of her company . the woman asked not to be identified over concerns that speaking publicly would hinder her ability to raise venture capital in the future . 

 > for hayes , each fundraising effort required more than 50 meetings , an unusually high number . hayes managed to raise $ 83 million in his first few years and achieved his biggest financial triumph last year . he raised $ 100 million in a single round for the business . lucidworks estimates it ’ll be on track to generate about $ 85 million in revenue next year . 

 > floyd ’s death introduced a new and highly personal management challenge for hayes . he had been advised for years to keep a low profile on racial issues , for fear of being labeled the “ angry black man ceo , ” he says . then , late last month , people were urging him to address the protests . “ if i was talking about this two weeks ago , the backlash would be severe , ” hayes says . “ now , all of a sudden , we need a statement . ” 

 > after considerable reflection , hayes wrote a long email and sent it to his employees early this month . he told a story about an encounter with the police when he was 12 years old . he was riding home from a dentist appointment on his skateboard when an officer threw him against a wall and pointed a gun to his face . he told another story about a sheriff who shot his friend three times in the back as he exited his car . hayes called for a “ massive overhaul ” of policing and the justice system . 

 > hayes says he was encouraged by the response . many people from lucidworks contacted him to voice their support , including a conservative salesman at the company who said he was enlightened by the memo , hayes says . two employees told him they read it aloud to their families to help their kids make sense of the protests . however , two other employees complained to human resources , saying , “ all lives matter . ” 

 > a passage from hayes ’s staff - wide email stands out . “ maddeningly , ” he wrote , “ our nation has now become so polarized , the simple phrase ‘ black lives matter ’ is seen as a political dog whistle , rather than a desperate cry to bring attention to a dire situation that many people choose not to see . ”",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_65538,"i 'm not sure how old you are and in what context you socialize with europeans ( back in your home country or maybe you 're studying abroad in a european country right now ) , so take this with a grain of salt , but i , and asian female , grew up in the us and felt really dingy and ugly compared to my white classmates , esp during hs , so i can understand the inferiority complex you are going through . 

 i like the "" fake it tell you break it "" approach mentioned in the other comment . i like to call it "" practice till its perfect "" .   at the end of the day , you have to keep practicing until it 's no longer an issue . each positive interaction you have with another european will override your other unpleasant experiences . sure , you will probably still get a good amount of rejection and ridicule by some of them , but most likely , by increasing the denominator , the proportion of negative experiences will decrease overall . 

 you also want to diversify your experience with europeans . say you only interact with a certain set of ppl at school or work . can you try to talk to europeans from other departments or groups ? it could be that you are only exposing yourself to a small group of europeans . this happened to me when i moved to the us for grad school . the americans in my school were horrible but i went out of my way to make friends outside and make me realize that it was n't "" all americans are mean "" but it was "" some americans can be mean "" . it 's will help in shifting your perspective . 

 anyways , that 's how you over come it . with each interaction , you can learn how to socialize and also stand up for your self . with each new interaction , you 'll see that not all of them are a certain way . like , are all europeans fashionable ? i do n't think so ...   but if you like their style , go ahead and learn from them and take in what you like . you can even use that as a topic to talk about . 

 now , i 've had instances where white ppl would n't even acknowledge my existence when i was sitting right in front of them and trying to talk to them ! ! this happened quite often during grad school . the same assholes would ask me or other asians for lecture notes later on . i would never give it to them , but sadly some other asians gave their notes for white ppl cookie points . no , do n't do that . you do n't need to kiss up to them when they 've dissed you . only be nice to them when they treat you equally like a human being . so you got ta grow some thick skin yourself . when someone looks disappointed when they hear where you 're from , it probably means they are n't sophisticated or educated enough to strike up a conversation with you . it 's not you , it 's them . but you can ask them nicely "" what do you know about my country ? "" "" where did you hear about this ? "" and that might shut them up or start a conversation . you just never know .   if someone asks "" how can you afford it here ? "" , you can tell them you studied your ass off for scholarship , or that you come from a wealthy family or whatever .   if you really wanted to , you could be smug towards them , but i 'd only do that if someone has offended me harshly . i do n't like stooping low . 

 in any case , becoming snarky , having enough knowledge yourself to counter ppl 's misconceptions , growing your own confidence etc takes time so do n't think this will resolve overnight , it will take a few yrs .

reddit_antiracist_70147,"to add to the above comments with some knowledge i picked up doing an anthropology undergrad degree : 

 the pigment and hair genetic differences are formally referred to as "" phenotype or phenotypical . "" 

 you could say that there are surface level , or phenotypical , differences between humans from different continents . as stated above , phenotype related genes make up relatively little genetic data compared to other parts of the dna . 

 i am 90 % sure of the accuracy of the next statistic but include it because it is illustrative of how we are all one race : when comparing two pairs of people , two white people from the same town and two black people from the same town , the two white people will have less genetic similarity to each other ( same for the two black people ) than if you compared one of the white people and one of the black people ( formally referred to as within population and between population genetic variability ) . wow . 

 this is because of the way population genetics work ... there is more genetic variability within small populations than there is between a pair of populations in different areas of the world . one explanation for this is that it 's an evolutionary development to keep populations from experiencing the types of genetic diseases seen in dogs that have been "" purebreed . "" think of it as human biodiversity . 

 to read more just google "" what is genetic variation and variability "" and you will get tons of educational resources ... maybe at an accessible beginners level . also search for "" what are alleles of genes . "" 

 i say the following to educate people : 

 race is a social construct , meaning that it has nothing to do with anything except physical appearances . race is a categorization scheme . the concept of race that exists in the usa is a tool of white supremacy developed to permit and excuse the crimes committed against minority groups . on a genetic level , the only race of homo sapiens is the human race .

medium_antiracist_17894,"a couple things that need to be said in response in my view there are two things missing in this piece which need to be commented on . the first is a common language . it is worth knowing that white people hear a term like “ white privilege ” through a filter of white man ’ s burden and white savior complex . the term does not communicate to white people , i think what is intended . call that privilege or what have you . this becomes even more important when discussing anticolonialism since white people tend to want to ride in on their high horses and save black and brown people from being able to make what they see as mistakes in their ways of life . the second is a point about history . colonialism , the slave trade , and much more arose after relatively poor white people were oppressed by nacient capitalism . this is fairly well understood by marxist and other economic historians . the enclosure of the commons in england and the highland clearances in scotland were primary points in the rise of capitalism in all its oppressive glory . we were oppressed by the white ruling class first and then told if we challenged that oppression , we ’ d be worse off ( like brown and black folks in distant colonies or brought in as slaves who were oppressed even more ) . see , our survival was tied , not into the things you mention , but being told we had to identify with the oppressors or we would be in for it . and then we were told that the minor indignities that the civil rights era did away with ended the worst of racism and that we were on a path to a color-blind soceity ( which basically means the assimilation of every group into the local white culture at any given social class ) . so when we hear we are privileged , we want to extend a helping hand , welcome you into the glorious white culture that you so obviously ( to us ! ) envy . this is why every effort at solving racial problems in the us since the civil rights era has involved efforts to destroy minority communities and integrate individuals into white culture ( and thereby misses the importance of family and community ) . and it continues . look at the efforts to internationalize white definitions of “ human rights ” at the expense of third world nations ’ liberation and ability to decide for themselves their own ways of life ( including family structures and everything that comes with those ) . in this respect , human rights is often the handmaiden of globalist capitalism and seeks to liberate people from family structures into the arms of corporations . i don ’ t see how to develop a common language though , and without a common language , i don ’ t see a way out of these cycles of oppression because we can not talk frankly about the problems .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_20921,"not in my house what a funny thing to debate . is it better to work on the inner self and heal our own wounds , or to stay grounded and spend our time trying to heal the world around us ? the impetus for this inner debate has been conflict within my intentional spiritual book club . every two weeks , i visit the living room of one of my spiritual sisters and we discuss our book of the month . we understand presence with tolle , and discuss shame with brene brown . we read books on shadow work and subconscious programming . we discuss all of our books in an open and loving space with a focal intention : inner evolution . as lives change , so too does membership rotate . in our annual meeting to choose new books , one new member suggested novels and nonfictional selections centered on race relations . her books did not receive enough votes to make the annual roster . our group ’ s clear focus , mindful exploration of self , was not aligned with her interests . surely we all understand the present political climate , but we choose to make this circle a space to only focus on healing the self . we are six caucasians and one asian american . even as i write this , i take ownership of the fact that we all chose to read books that served our own growth and we could have made different- and more racially inclusive- choices . when this member shared disappointment that her racially relevant books were not represented on our roster , i self reflected . i appreciated her input , but also knew i had voted for books that resonated with my own goals . i am healing from a toxic relationship and want to nurture my soul back to her full and vital self . a choice i did not question until i faced a singular occasion . another new member lamented how unfair it was that businesses owned by trump supporters were boycotted . she proceeded that voting for trump didn ’ t make someone racist . she was upset at this “ cancel-culture ” and the “ double standard ” we see in media today . cancel culture is the idea that a person or brand is unfairly canceled for making a perceived offensive remark . my blood went cold . in my perspective , it sounded like the thinly veiled racism of a white woman regurgitating conservative views . as the only nonwhite member of the group , and as a woman passionately against racism and systemic inequality , i surged with emotion . so much so that i shared with the group that the term double-standard triggered me . i requested a moment to step back and collect my thoughts instead of letting this text thread turn into a flare of tempers . she asked me in a private text , what about the term “ double standard ” offends you ? and , she reassured me , it was all love and she had not directed any of her comments specifically at me . brushing off the racist undertones of her latter comment , i asked her simply to explain what she meant by the term double standard . she replied , “ example attack on the capitol . that was fully jumped on as wrong ( which it is ) but the riots and destruction that went on last spring/summer was justified . that ’ s a double standard . violence is violence . you can ’ t say i ’ m for this version yet hell no not for this one . using this as an example. ” yes we are told to not assume , but my assumption of her biases was categorically confirmed . she meant every bit of ridiculous rhetoric that i thought she did when she casually dropped the term double standard . i felt the group had been infiltrated . there was a racist among us . this woman has been unable to call me to address my concern and feelings since the exchange . her behavior was the factor that made this such an offense to me . i am in this group to grow and to help others grow as well . she had an opportunity to expand her view and chose instead to retreat and avoid accountability . so back to my original question . is it better to work on the inner self and heal our own wounds , or to stay grounded and spend our time trying to heal the world around us ? my answer may surprise you . this biased book club member has political views that skew from the rest of our group . she is also deeply unconscious of her own neural patterns and propensity to play the victim . i have spoken to the group about reading a racial awareness title , in large part because it is clear this member has not expanded her view of her own accord . but what i also have realized , is that i am the only person so deeply offended by her commentary . and it is important to me that my circle of sisters stand firm in opposition to any racism within our organization . so we will read this selection , and face our unconscious biases as a group , because we all are choosing to see our own subconscious demons . it is my hope that the next time someone makes a racist comment , i am not the only member adamantly asking for a higher moral standard . with all that said , spiritual books remain my primary focus . for if we do not heal our own wounds and patterns , we are stuck in an unconscious holding pattern . and when we can not see and honor our own pain , it is nearly impossible to deeply empathize with the pain of another human . to heal racism , educating every individual on the deeply ingrained injustice felt by black america or minority america will often not be enough . first , that individual has to want to evolve . and the only way they will ever change is by deeply committing to working through their own demons and loving themselves . the unhappy human is the one that finds faults and blames and relinquishes responsibility to create the world we all deserve . the unaware human is the one quick to jump to the defense instead of choosing to earnestly listen to another point of view . i truly believe in the goodness of humanity . by healing ourselves , we can then align to our highest frequency and manifest love for all beings in this world : self , friends and family , strangers , and others . and we clearly can not make it to the last category until we do the work . these views are mine and mine alone . as a minority i have dealt with racism , but i do not know the personal experiences of others . i sincerely and humbly hope my views do not offend anyone due to my own unconscious racial biases , and welcome any feedback to expand my own awareness of self .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_570,"confronting the past : the meaning ( s ) of the rebel flag okay , yes , that opening image is a bit of a cheap shot . i apologize , and as you will see this post is not meant to bash southerners or southern heritage . their stereotypical characterization in the media as unintelligent and/or racist hicks is both unfair and undeserved . but with that said , the debate on displaying the confederate flag in all its versions that has reached fever pitch in our nation over the last week , so it might be time to think about why that banner is so significant to many southerners , and why despite those reasons , state and local governments must wash their hands of its use and cleanse themselves from its stains by taking it down . while many have spoken out against this symbol in the past , the horrific and tragic killings at the emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston sc have brought the debate to its tipping point , urging americans to face this subject directly in a thoughtful and honest way . it has been easy for critics of the flag , both then and now , to lambaste southern states for flying what seems an obvious symbol of bigotry , hatred , and even treason over their capital buildings and state houses . it seems a no-brainer to demand its removal . it might be helpful at this point to imagine the culture of the south as a kind of ship , moving its citizens along the sea of history . if that were the case , you would not be looking at a speedboat or jet ski : agile and quick to change direction . rather , a better comparison might be an enormous sailed ship carrying colossal amounts of cargo that weigh it down in the water — clumsy and slow to maneuver , and beholden to the currents and winds that slowly propel it . that cargo is loaded with many different weighty ideas . southern states and their citizens do not typically associate the flag with the idea of slavery , but rather the more romantic archetypes of chivalry , nobility , and gallantry . in his pulitzer prize winning 1998 book confederates in the attic , author tony horwitz helps paint a more current picture of the southern notion of the lost cause held by many over the years . he explained how history had shifted to nostalgia , and they had come to disassociate the more practical causes of the war and remember it as good versus evil , personal freedoms versus centralized control . still often known in the south as the “ war of northern aggression ” , it ’ s a narrative that continued during the civil rights era in the 1950s and 60s . southern states refused to follow federal laws enforcing voting and education rights for blacks and claimed the government did not have the right to compel them to do so . they didn ’ t say , “ let us be racist ” , but rather “ let us make our own decisions ” . eisenhower , kennedy , and johnson however , did not agree , and all used federal force to coerce states to obey laws and court decisions that upheld racial reform in the south . it was during this period that some states , like south carolina and georgia for example , began displaying the rebel flag prominently as a kind of middle finger to the federal government . interestingly , the 1970s somewhat altered the tone of the emblem , and opened what became perhaps it ’ s most popular period in its antebellum history . the rebel flag gained a stronger connection to the ideals of being outsiders , individuals , or good-natured bad boys that know how to have fun and “ bend ” the rules . it became an embodiment of the charismatic rogue . this idea was personified for my generation by the dukes of hazard , a show where two handsome country boys drove around breaking laws in the tradition of robin hood . bo & luke duke , along with cousin daisy , stood for those previously noted ideals of chivalry , and always outsmarted the establishment and made their getaway in the high-powered general lee , a bright colored muscle car with the rebel flag emblazoned on its roof and a custom horn that played “ dixie ” . but the message went beyond that single show . southern rock bands filled stadiums with anthems promoting southern values , and the stars and bars were always a part of lynard skynard or allman brothers shows . nascar events featured them all throughout the stands… and only recently removed them . even the most adored cultural phenomenon of the 70s sung the praises of rebels , revolt , and confederacy in star wars , where a consolidated power tried to impose its collective will on these outsiders who just wanted to do things their own way . picturing han solo as a roguish confederate cavalry leader , or luke skywalker as a farmer from georgia instead of tatooine wasn ’ t that much of a stretch . the confederate flag shifted for many from a symbol of racism or treason to one of individualism and fun . the winds of history however , are shifting . if tony horwitz were writing today about the lost cause in the south , he would find a much different response . primarily driven by technology , globalization and social media , more progressive and liberal themes have embedded themselves into large portions of southern culture . those in the south today who have been raised in the age of the internet ( say… under 40 ) feel far more connected to the traditions of modern america ( i.e . consumerism , celebrity , & iphones ) than the previously mentioned values that seem better suited to king arthurs court . even the republican party that has dominated the south since the interventions of kennedy and johnson has begun to distance itself from the flag , as south carolina governor nikki haley ( r ) and many presidential hopefuls have pushed to remove the banner in from flying in that state . i wish it were true that the recent attack in charleston was unique and uncommon , but unfortunately that is simply not the case . the huffington post recently reported a study showing 91 violent acts against churches since 1956 , including bombings , shootings , and arson . the numbers are staggering , and when combined with recent tensions over treatment by blacks by police , seem to have inspired a new awakening of civil rights protests in our nation . the recently trending # whoisburningblackchurches serves as another chilling reminder . a new rosa parks might have emerged when bree newsome was detained after scaling the flagpole outside of the south carolina statehouse to personally remove the confederate flag . after her arrest , she eloquently remarked that she “ removed the flag today because we can ’ t wait any longer . we can ’ t continue like this another day… it ’ s time for a new chapter where we are sincere about dismantling white supremacy and building toward true racial justice and equality ” . strong words . and they built upon president obama ’ s emotional eulogy for the murdered rev . clementa pinckney , where the president noted , “ for too long we were blind to the pain the confederate flag stirred into many of our citizens…it ’ s true a flag did not cause these murders , ” but as people from all walks of life now acknowledge…the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride . for many , black and white , that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation . we see that now . removing the flag from this state ’ s capitol would not be an act of political correctness . it would not be an insult to the valor of confederate soldiers . it would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought — the cause of slavery — was wrong. ” the roots of slavery and racism in the united states are deep , twisted , and lying just beneath the surface for the entire nation . they are sometimes unearthed in the process of building new foundations for progress . but that ’ s the problem with deep roots . they cling to the soil of the past with a savage ferocity and are so very difficult to alter . but this may be that time , and that soil may finally be ready to release its grip on that part of our past . perhaps ironically , the leaders of both sides on the civil war entreated their followers to move past the cultural beliefs and behaviors that had led to the conflict . abraham lincoln called upon the north to forget grudges , and welcome southerners back into the union to “ bind up the nation ’ s wounds ” . jefferson davis did the same for listeners in the south , urging them to abandon any idea of a lost cause and to “ lay aside all rancor , all bitter sectional feeling ” . davis added , “ the past is dead ” . for many in the south it has come time to finally heed those words , and bury the flag deep in the churned soil . originally published at

 > rose city antifa ( rca ) was founded in portland , oregon in october of 2007 . rca was formed after a coalition of local people and organizations formed the ' ad - hoc coalition against racism and fascism ' in order to shut down a neo - nazi skinhead festival called hammerfest . rca continues the work of that ad - hoc coalition and countless others who have worked to oppose racial prejudice , bigotry and fascism in our communities in portland , oregon , and the pacific northwest more broadly . 

 > rose city antifa opposes fascist organizing through direct action , education , and through solidarity with leftist spaces , activists , and organizations . 

 > direct action is any work that prevents fascist organizing , and when that is not possible , provides consequences to fascist organizers . this is supported by researching and tracking fascist organizations . 

 > education helps us give our communities the information they need to recognize and oppose fascism . fascists often hide their ideas and try to co - opt other movements , like environmentalism , anti - captialism , and anti - globalism . sometimes they may even claim to be feminists . it is important that our community is able to see and understand what fascism is , what gives it power , and how to stop it . 

 > solidarity helps us model the kind of world we want to live in : a classless society , free from all forms of oppression . we ally ourselves with other groups that have similar values , and support them in their organizing . through this solidarity , we hope to create radical spaces that can not only grow these movements , but also act as a viable alternative to those that seek community and may be preyed on by fasicsts who provide false solutions to problems of class and alienation in our society .

medium_antiracist_7328,"# yourlifematters i ’ m a person who likes to have answers . but in the wake of the recent shootings i ’ ve felt numb , helpless . no solutions . i hate it . but i feel like i have to say something . it ’ s what i do . express myself with words . but it seems like every phrase nowadays inflames someone . if i say # blacklivesmatter then there will be those who get offended thinking that by saying this , i ’ m saying that other lives don ’ t matter . if i say # bluelivesmatter then people are going to think that i don ’ t believe that black lives matter . that i ’ m somehow supporting “ the oppressor. ” it ’ s sad that these cries of solidarity have become points of contention . with people throwing one out as a counter to the other . we as a society really have to get past this concrete idea of “ for or against ” — you are either for me or against me and there is no room for common ground or room for more than one “ truth ” to exist . it surprises me how some people see themselves as so progressive and enlightened , yet are completely closed minded when it comes to even trying to gain a true understanding of anything outside of their own limited life experience . or how they are , in certain cases , unable to admit that they can ’ t fully understand such things . at it ’ s core , when someone says black lives matter , they are not saying that other lives do not matter or that black lives are somehow more important or superior to other lives , they are simply saying that in certain circumstances , we as a nation need to open our eyes to the fact that blacks are often treated as if our lives aren ’ t as valuable as others ’ . especially in the justice system . and that by realizing and admitting these flaws we can work to correct them . one has to understand that the black community has been plagued by injustice since before my parents were born . look up how entire towns like rosewood fl , and black wall street in oklahoma were decimated by whites and very few , if any people were ever brought to justice for their actions . entire generations of black people have grown up in fear of men in white hoods , and men in blue uniforms , who terrorize their neighborhoods and families and are rarely ever brought to justice . and that ’ s just a fact . and it ’ s sad . and it ’ s painful , and it ’ s ugly . but it stands true , just take an earnest look at black history . then you fast-forward to the incidents we see today of black people being gunned down and no one truly being held responsible , and you can begin to see why # blacklivesmatter is not a brag or an exclusionary phrase but a reminder that hey…we are human , we deserve fair treatment and justice . we have value and we matter . yes all lives matter , but black lives are lives too . it ’ s very interesting to note that if you look at the past . those who ignore the cries of groups who claim to be oppressed oftentimes find themselves on the wrong side of history . but i digress . when any public official , especially a policeman is killed , we see this general public outcry , and a surge of support and calls for justice for the fallen officer . and rightly so in most cases . but no such universal outcry typically exists in cases of black lives . instead we hear stories about how flawed the black person was . how he or she looked like a thug , had a past criminal history , and other irrelevant straw man arguments that try to distract , like “ what about black on black crime ? ” all this is to say i don ’ t yet have answers on how to fix the issues of racism , bias , bigotry and hate . i know that violence isn ’ t the answer . but i ’ ve also pretty much lost all faith in the system being able to provide equal justice for my community . but i offer this perspective shift for us all to consider… your life matters . if we all have this mentality about each and every person we encounter it could fundamentally change the world . the golden rule is the most profound statement i have ever come across when it comes to human interaction .. do unto others what you would have them do unto you . it ’ s simple , but so deep . if i don ’ t want to see myself hurt or killed or treated unfairly then i shouldn ’ t want that for you . your life matters to me , because my life matters to me . and because anything that can happen to you as a human can happen to me . that is the root and the source of the golden rule and it ’ s something that seems to be lost in this discussion of whose right and whose wrong . the problem that we have in our society is a lack of empathy , and an inability of people to put themselves in another person ’ s shoes . of course you ’ re going to see someone who doesn ’ t share your skin color or social circle and life experience as some “ other ” if you can ’ t look at them and see a part of yourself inside of them . so when you see someone putting # blacklivesmatter think about it with your own circumstance . do you think that your life matters ? the life of your child ? now what if your family had a history of being treated as if your lives didn ’ t matter ? what if you wanted to let people know this was the case , but they called you paranoid and told you to get over it ? in a similar situation would you not scream out for truth , transparency and fair and equal justice ? in our society we see too many differences to really live by the golden rule . but then we want to call ourselves progressive and post-racism , when if we ’ re honest , we don ’ t even see that unfamiliar-looking guy walking down the street as someone like us , or even human , so much as a potential hazard to our safety . at the end of the day we have to break it down and follow the golden rule and say your life matters…and if we apply this even down to our regular social interactions , up to our lawmaking processes , we would have a greater sense of unity and progress . i don ’ t have all the answers but i do know every major change starts grassroots . everything starts with the individual . from within . with the changing of consciousness and perspectives and saying your life mattes in every aspect that my life matters . and in order to do that we have to see each others ’ s life as a life , as a human , just like we see ourselves . when we finally get this perspective then we can finally begin to fundamentally change the world . all of our issues are a symptom of the disease which is our ability to put ourselves in each other ’ s shoes and truly realize that all lives do matter . and that despite our differences of opinion we can truly listen to each other because # your-life-matters # your-ideas-matter # your-thoughts-matter # your-addition-to-society-matters . when we begin to teach our kids to see life through # yourlifematters we can see a change . i know it ’ s a lofty idea , and impractical and doesn ’ t provide answers to the right now… but adopting the perspective of your life matters is simple and fundamental . we wouldn ’ t even have the history that we have with gun violence if that were in our consciousness already . it ’ s the long instilled idea of i ’ m separate that you , i ’ m somehow apart from you that got us here in the first place . with the perspective of your life matters how could you ever make someone your slave ?

 the police officers can kill with impunity line was really more theoretical than factual . was probably a bit confusing as i tried to avoid slang like "" pretty much "" . it is clearly not true , but it seems to me like that is what we are setting a precedent for with all these grand juries not indicting . i ended up changing to "" gave a message to some people that police officers can kill with impunity "" .

reddit_antiracist_51801,"the stem fields are notoriously white- male dominated .    some , like medicine , have shown some improvement in recent years .    others , like my own field of geoscience , are still like 90 % white dudes .   it 's a product of the same systemic racism that leads to shit policing .   there 's a few theories as to why ,   so i 'll break them down .   it 's basically lack of opportunity . 

 minority communities tend to have underfunded schools that teach strictly to standardized testing ( minimum requirements for funding ) .   this means a lot of math and science is left out of the curriculum and what is there is probably not taught well .    to get people interested in a topic you have to introduce them to it .   

 this is problem two , at least in my field .   poor schools do n't have field trips to places like big museums or national parks .   and since those places require admission fees and/ transportation ,   kids at these schools are unlikely to get to go outside of school either .    the national parks service surveys park visitors and collects census data as part of research into how they 're doing .   they found that non hispanic whites account for between 88 - 95 % of all visitors to public lands .   i can tell you how awesome geology is , but i feel like a lot of people might not get it if you 've never been able to look at a series of tilted rock layers or found a fossil fish high up on a desert mountain .   that 's my experience , anyway , and it 's biased .    i 'm from the past of the country where the geology is all around you and obvious , and still most people find it boring .   i can not imagine never getting to see a proper mountain .    but that is literally someone 's life - someone reading this who has never left the city .  

 minority students are less likely to go to college , and those that do are less likely to go into the sciences .    it could be due to lack of interest ,   but i personally think about of it is also the way we are steered .   i 'm a hispana , and i definitely felt like in my first few years of college at least i was   constantly being emailed by advisors with literal funding ads for liberal arts classes , particularly minority studies .   i got email invites to all the hispanic and women 's societies and clubs as soon as i applied , but even after i declared an eps major i never got a big fancy email from the geology club .   mostly because they do n't do emails like that ,   but the fact that based solely on my name and gender i got a lot of material trying to pull me into chicano and women 's studies .   other people 's experience might be different , and it 's not that i do n't think people who want to should n't go into the liberal arts - someone has to or no one talks about our shit-   but i 'm sure there are plenty of similar cases .   

 in any case , the national science foundation keeps track of the race and gender of us graduates of a shit ton of fields and degree types .   here 's the link ; 



 now when i was looking at this data , i was looking to answer why there are so few natives or lantinx people in the earth sciences for a class project ( i 'm mestizo so i noticed the trend right away and wondered about it ) but the data holds up regardless of race or gender . 

 non - hispanic white men account for the majority of graduates in every degree type in almost ever field ( women are starting overtake men in medicine and biology , but it 's white women ) .  
 
 so here 's the thing ,   and how it relates to blm .   why ?   why do n't more minority students go into stem ? do they not want to ? or are they not given it as an option ?   can they afford it ?   see how graduation rates plummet even further in grad school ?   you have to take a 300 $ test and then pay 80 $ per copy   of your results to get into most grad schools .   it 's called the gre and a ton of schools are starting to drop it as a requirement to get in because they believe(rightly so ) that it is just another barrier to potential students .   it 's the same reason most state and public colleges and pretty much all community colleges have dropped the sat / act requirements .   it 's a test you have to pay for that measures only how well you take that test and is not a reliable indicator of future academic success in any way .   

  i highly doubt it 's because these issues are n't important to us - medical and environmental problems disproportionately affect us .   if there 's a lack of interest it 's not out of apathy .   it 's more that minority kids are n't being given the opportunity and option of going into stem , and that 's a problem .  

 in any case , the point is we need more diversity in stem .   there 's a ton of empirical reasons why - diverse backgrounds breed diverse solutions to problems and other studies you can google - but also because it 's just the right thing to do .    knowledge belongs to everyone and no one should suffer from a lack of educational opportunity ,   especially not because of a system that denies them for their melanin content and gender .   what stupid , insignificant things to judge people on .   we have to do better .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_68984,"in india , racism operates on so many different levels i think - caste system , toward other people of colour , toward the people of different states within india , toward the people within the same caste but of a different sub caste , the list goes on .   the worst encounter that i can recall was when i went out for dinner with a white woman . i did n’t get a very good feeling during our meeting and always felt like she was after my money . i tried to point this out indirectly but she did n’t get it . she kept asking me to meet her again and after dodging initially , i finally said no , to which she replied that i should go back to my country , and that i was n’t welcome here , and that i was a “ dirty man ” . when i came to the us for my masters , i felt a stark difference in a number of things between how things work here and how things work back in india . so much stress here is laid on individuality , freedom and equality in conversations and in daily lives in general , but we do n’t talk about racism as much as we should unless it ’s someone who posts about it on social media(and the post goes viral ) or a video regarding the same goes viral . there are certain things implicit in a society , and i believe they should be . but i believe that some things that are implicit in one society are n’t implicit in another . we laud assertiveness , hard work , critical thinking and other sterling aspects of our personalities in america . but the fact that racism feels right in our bones and is n’t usually very overt , why do n’t we ever talk about that ? someone said something about the representation in media does n’t help , of course it does n’t help . i grew up in one of the poorest states in india called bihar . but i received the best education possible - went to a pretty good high school , aced my exams , won an international gold medal while at school , went to one of the top 10 engineering colleges in the country , got published and still kept aspiring for more . it really hurts when all of that is sidelined just because of the colour of my skin . media shows india is about spicy food and spirituality . yes you get spicy food in india , like so many other countries . yes spirituality is what the westerners come to india to look for . but why does n’t anyone talk about people like jaiprakash narayan - the leader who rebelled against the indira gandhi government during the years of emergency and saved the country from descending into tyranny , places like tirthan valley - where the quiet is just the right kind of quiet we need with the sound of river flowing being the only sound for miles and the quiet which we desperately need , and so many other things which might seem obvious to so many people in india but not to people in the west ? i wish i had some solution to all of this , but i just do n’t see any solution . india is n’t just bollywood , india is the land of satyajit ray , govind nihalani , ritwik ghatak , shyam benegal and so many pioneering filmmakers . india is n’t just spicy food , india has a wide range of foods which are rich in taste not just because they ’re spicy . you find assholes in india , like anywhere else . but you find kind and emotionally intelligent people in india too who look beyond the differences in the colours of the skin .",reddit_antiracist

 i hope i can post here . 
 white canadian here . growing up in vancouver , there have never been many black families living here back in the day .    1980s . but i remember my best friend was stu . he was from guyana . i grew up with him , sleep overs with his mom and dad taking care of us as my single mom needed help . ( reverse of the usa story , black family taking care of poor white kids ) . my older brother and i almost lived there for awhile . he had cousins from toronto and chicago always coming over , aunties .. all caribbean family awesomeness ! . my brother and i did n't see colour .. seriously ! i was a kid .. we just had fun .. it was some of my best memories . 


 but , i remember in grade 5 , watching kids call stu . n .... r for no reason ! he 's 1 of 3 black kids in school .. so , i m a little guy but i do n't keep quiet .. stu he 's a big dude compared to us white and asian kids . stu never lost his cool . he took the comments and did n't seem to care . but now that i reflect on his face , he was hurt each time he was called names .. he was a child .. he was alone as a black person .. he just took the pain .. he just kept going . he never said anything to us .. he kept going . but , this one time in grade 5 , we are standing in line about to go into the changing room . this big bully brian ( white blonde , line backer guy ) starts shit .. calls stu you fn n .... r !  

 damn ... brian was a big dude .. stu ... exploded .. took brian down fast . started kicking his head against the concrete wall .. you know , the brick wall in school ? i remember hearing the .. pong .. pong ..  

 ya … sounds terrible , brian coulda died ! 

 nah .. he has a fat head . 


 stu , got in trouble of course . but brian never ever fucked with stu again . 

 i watched the same shit happen over and over with stu .. he fights when he 's being called down or out . he earned respect with all people . today , he is a big deal . 

 . 

 i guess the point is , i never thought about how hard stu had it growing up being black . he took a lot of shit . he always kept his cool . almost like he expected the shit .

 “ i must confess that over the past few years i have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate . i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negro 's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the white citizen 's counciler or the ku klux klanner , but the white moderate , who is more devoted to ' order ' than to justice ; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice . ”

what will awaken us to this terror ? what is the turning point for us to realize that something has gone horribly wrong ? 505 people have been killed by the police this year . killed . their parents no longer get to call them or visit them for the holidays . their spouses no longer cook them dinner after a long day of work . their children no longer rush to the door in excitement to see their mother , or their father , or their parent come home . their co-workers no longer hear their jokes . their community no longer sees them leaving for work . because they were killed . 505 people have been killed by the police this year . and that gives police officers the right to kill him ? and that gives police officers the right to kill her ? and that gives police officers the right to kill him ? and that gives police officers the right to kill her ? and that gives police officers the right to kill him ? and that gives police officers the right to kill her ? there are instances in the line of duty that police officers must use deadly force to protect their own life . police officers risk their life to protect our communities and we should honor their sacrifice . there are so many documented examples of officers responding above and beyond the call of duty to save themselves , their brothers and sisters in the force , and their communities from aggressors with deadly weapons , actively shooting at them , seeking to harm them , seeking to rip them away from their families and their communities and their lives . but in honoring them , we should never be afraid . and there are so many communities that are afraid of their police officers . because if we carry a toy gun , like christine lucas ( a 45-year-old white woman in maryland ) , we will be shot and killed . because if we flee an arrest , like michael lynch ( a 37-year-old white man in texas ) , we will be shot and killed . because if we even have a weapon , like alton sterling ( a 37-year-old black man in louisiana ) , we will be shot and killed . when will it be enough ? what will awaken us to this terror ? what is the turning point for us to realize that something has gone horribly wrong ? we have become complacent , desensitized , numb to the idea that police officers have the right to kill . since when ? is due process now in the hands of a police officer , pointing a gun out of fear of her life ? is due process now sacrificed any moment there is a whiff of danger in a situation ? is due process now surrendered when a mentally ill man charges a police officer with a knife , caught in his own mental hallucinations of reality ? tennessee v. garner , the famous 1985 supreme court case that defined parameters of use of deadly force said : and law enforcement establishes that the use of deadly force is a force of last result . but when amnesty international releases a report that us laws do not meet international human right standards for use-of-force by law enforcement , we should be concerned . the key findings : a government that has no set legal requirement for lethal force to be used as a last resort , allows it to be used to suppress a riot , allows it to kill fleeing prisoners , allows it to be used without verbal warning , and allows it to be used without training should paint a picture closer to north korea than the united states . our cinema produces movies showing valiant heroes escaping foreign prisons and countries with those use-of-force standards to return home to the us , not fleeing our prisons and our communities . we have begun to accept deadly force as the norm . as something acceptable . that if you even approach the idea of being violent to the police , you will be targeted , beaten , and killed . and of course , if you ’ re black , you ’ re more likely to be jailed , and killed , than your white friends . and if you ’ re young and black and male , you ’ re nine times more likely than other americans to be killed by police officers . this alone does not prove racial discrimination , does not prove excessive use of force is disproportionate toward black communities , or that police officers are simple more likely to target young black men . but in what world should we simply be a bystander to the disproportionate killing of our brothers and sisters ? white or black ? male or female ? have we really accepted that young black men should be more likely to be killed ? have we genuinely internalized a narrative that it is their fault , that “ they should ’ ve known better ” ? do we not see the bigger picture , the bigger problem ? “ black lives matter ” is not a phrase that black lives matter more . it is a cry from a community that has been disenfranchised , marginalized , discriminated against , and structurally disadvantaged since the founding of this nation . “ black lives matter ” does not mean police lives don ’ t matter , or that police lives matter less . it is a plea to police officers to fight with them against a system of government whose policies disadvantage their communities as they fight against poverty , against unemployment , against low wages , against unequal health access , against brutality , against discrimination . “ black lives matter ” is an appeal to every other part of society to pull back the curtain and see that our policies have not equalized the playing field , they have not created equal opportunity , they have not solved the systemic issues that black communities fought against in the 1860s , the 1880s , the 1920s , the 1940s , the 1960s , the 1980s , and into today . there is a reason they are still fighting and we need to start to listen . and not just listen , but work to solve these problems . police brutality is simply one symptom of these larger structural issues . it impacts white communities and black communities ; it impacts men and women ; it impacts our whole society . but if you grew up in a neighborhood where parents were continually unemployed , where gang violence and drugs use was high , where the sidewalks weren ’ t clean and the schools weren ’ t well-funded , where you didn ’ t have access to grocery stores or cars of your own or even clean water , and you lived every day in fear of “ how an officer with a gun will react to [ you ] , ” ( sotomayor , p.12 ) and you saw communities in the very same city who had the exact opposite lifestyle , you might start to believe that the system was rigged , that the echoes from governments past still ring into today and the policies they once chose still resonate into communities , into schools , into homes , into families , and that the structures and policies we have put into place to absolve ourselves of our past sins haven ’ t worked to solve the problems our society once fought against . when will it be enough ? what will awaken us to this terror ? what is the turning point for us to realize that something has gone horribly wrong ? do you accept that police should have the right to kill you if you brandish a toy weapon ? if you flee arrest ? that your wife or husband , boyfriend or girlfriend , brother or sister , mother or father , should have to attend your funeral because of this ? when will it be enough ? what will awaken us to this terror ? what is the turning point for us to realize that something has gone horribly wrong ? do you think that it is really just black people ’ s unwillingness to pull themselves up by their bootstraps , their inability to fight for their opportunities , to work hard ? or that they are simply more violent than other americans ? when will it be enough ? what will awaken us to this terror ? what is the turning point for us to realize that something has gone horribly wrong ?

 out of curiousity , he took a standard iq test ( starting page 39 ): 

 "" ... the general knowledge subtest begins with a question like "" what is the capitol of france ? "" and culminates with ones like "" who wrote the aeneid ? "" and "" what is the circumference of the earth ? "" 

 "" i was particularly struck during my own test by how banal the various tasks were ..... none of the tasks required the ability to reflect on a topic or critically analyze an idea , nor was there any opportunity for creative thought ..... for example , how would you answer the following question : "" what do a fly and a tree have in common ? ""   little surprise that these restricted response questions were the ones with which i struggled most ... "" 

 ( page 46 ) "" to see how coming from a different culture can affect your iq score , try answering the following questions based on an australian aborigine culture , the kuuk thaayorre , in far north queensland : 

 1 .   what number comes next in the sequence : one , two , three ? 

 the answer is mong or ' many ' - the kuok thaayorre system of counting only goes up to three . 

 2 .   wallaby is to animal as cigarette is to ? 

 "" tree "" is the right answer .   this comes from the kuuk thaaayorre speakers ' early experience of tobacco , which was "" stick "" tobacco , hence it is classified with trees . 

 3 .   which items may be classified with sugar :   honey , witcherry grub , flour , water lilies ? 

 all the items are classified with sugar as they all belong to the class of objects know as ' may ' , or "" vegetable food . :   witcherry grubs are so assigned because they are found in the roots of trees , and honey because it is also associated with trees and hence fruit .   flour is included in the ' may ' category because it resembles some of the community 's own processed vegetable foods . "" 

 ( page 44 , two more questions , you can read the book for complete explanations ) 

 4 .   sam , ben , and harry are sitting together .   sam faces ben , and ben gives him a cigarette .   harry sits quietly with his back to both ben and sam and contributes nothing to the animated conversation going on between sam and ben .   one of the men is ben 's brother ;   the other is ben 's sister 's child .   who is the nephew ?   ( harry ) 

 5 .   you are out in the bush with your wife and young children and you are all hungry .   you have a rifle and bullets .   you see three animals all within range - a young emu , a large kangaroo , and a small female wallaby .   which should you shoot for food ?   ( the small female wallaby ) ""

 this is why when black and brown people build communities , they are so often priced out - because when there is potential to increase value , developers do not hold back on account of the lives they will disrupt . 

 that is why and how the racist police state was built - capitalists used their power to colonize land that had the potential to increase in value , using labor they got at a flat rate . these actions required more than power . to go through with genocide and slaving they needed a glaring disregard for human life . that does n't sit well with the soul , so they made up platitudes about how they were more deserving by some metric - education , civilization , or the bald - faced lie that white skin was , itself , a virtue to be upheld .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_88038,"ok , i 'm going to make another comment about this . 

 as far as my reasoning on this goes , i do n't believe that abstracting race from humanity .. or viewing humanity as a whole rather than dividing it into as many ethnic / cultural / racial groups as possible makes me a racist . i see race , but i think the activity of divisive behavior is hurtful . 

 i understand that as a white person i might be considered a racist because i 'm considered to be part of the oppressive majority who rule ( or have ruled ) over the minority . and that saying ignoring it will make it go away ... but on an individual level , i wish that opportunities among all humans would be equal , resources divided equally , regardless of race/ or any sort of divisive means people have come up with in the past . i know that this is n't the current state of affair throughout the globe . 
 i 'm not ignoring the power dynamics , i 'm pointing it out ! 
 but i 'm already convinced that it 's fucked up . 
 to be less racist , and by extension , reducing the emphasis humans put on dividing each other , controlling each other , interacting with each other , based purely on race , is to talk about race abstract from humanity . it 's not by ignoring it that it will become to be so . it 's by doing the opposite . 

 so , do i have to point out to everyone i meet that i 'm not racist in order to not be racist ? i 'm asking you because i want to know what you would say to a racist person to make him change his mind . i 'm not the one you have to convince . would you disagree that racial minorities have less opportunities to resources than white people ? if so , then who implemented those policies ? can we make those policies change ? how about people who are prejudice ? racial profiling police officers still exist ? what would they say if they were asked ? 
 if we talk about these things to the point where everything actually becomes equal , then does race still exist ? of course .   you would n't ignore it then , and you should n't ignore it now . but the thing that is disgusting , repulsive , is people who uphold these divisive ideologies . who maintain themselves in a privileged position which by definition means that someone suffers . and those who suffer have a right to complain about their suffering . but .. as privileged as this sounds , i think that suffering based on race is absurd .

 the word "" racist "" is seen as an offensive remark . when you call someone out for being a racist they act as offended as a minority would be to chink , paki or nigger . people get so fucking defensive and refuse to accept that just because you are nt in a klan uniform you can still hold racist views . 

 "" playing the race card "" is the biggest load of shit and it boils my blood when people use it to discredit a minorities suggestion that racism is in play . 

 i think white people ( not all , and the fact i have to say "" not all "" pissed me off ) lack an enormous amount of insight in what its like to be an ethnic minority . "" b - b - but minorities can be racist too ! "" . of course they can but calling someone a cracker does nt hurt a white person nearly as much as the previously mentioned terms imo . 
 i m mixed race , asian and white . i ve lived in both of my "" home "" countries and received racist comment from both sides . when i was insulted for being white it did nt hurt me , we live in a white mans world , the movies , tv , music all these people listened to was from white people . when i was called a chink it hurt , because it reminds you of how far society has to come , how you will never be accepted in the "" white world "" , how people every day are angry and hate you for absolutely no reason other than your skin . maybe i m biased . 



 when it comes to the internet , reddit is one of the worst offenders . 

 to answer your question . yes it makes me angrier than anything else . i may not share the same experiences as other minorities but i can fully empathize with the struggle to a certain degree and try to highlight problems with racism to my friends as much as i can .

medium_antiracist_7374,"the only way forward is to acknowledge # blacklivesmatter yesterday , the following post by blue lives matter appeared on my facebook newsfeed : apparently , blue lives matter — yes , the similarity in name forms a verbal sting that i can only interpret as a way of ignoring , downplaying or reversing black lives matter ’ s concerns — is a facebook page mostly concerned with countering the negative attention the police force in the united states has recently endured . i ’ m trying to avoid the pro-cop denomination here as i believe it has an undesirable polarizing effect . the post above was shared by some of my friends on facebook and that is how it reached me . to give you an idea of my subjective position in this debate , i ’ m a white guy from holland studying anthropology so i ’ m quite the outsider . but maybe that ’ s a good thing . i chose to write a piece about this particular post because i believe it ’ s narrative encompasses a particular response to the black lives matter movement and because it symbolizes some of the crooked logic and power misuse that seems to form a part of contemporary police culture in the us . so , where to begin ? kevin doesn ’ t seem to comprehend the outrageous consequences of his logic . first of all , kevin admits being summoned by the police to interrupt his daily activities an absurd amount of times . so often in fact that we might conclude it wasn ’ t always for an apparent reason . he couldn ’ t possibly have been doing something suspicious or illegal every single time . he also suggests that the environment in which he found himself didn ’ t matter . so for some unclear reason which he fails to reflect upon , kevin was simply so very lucky to be the continuous target of police questioning , as he rather proudly establishes . but that should be a major concern , right ? sure kevin , ignore it . apparently , it doesn ’ t bother you . secondly , kevin states that all those instances of questioning never resulted in any type of violence because he respected the police ’ s authority and their orders . sure , fair enough . i agree that officers should be treated with respect and that their authority in certain situations should be recognized and their orders heeded . by the way , i believe respect only really works by way of reciprocity . but it ’ s the second part of his sentence that left me astonished . kevin indicates that he treats officers with respect because he ’ d “ rather leave humble with a handshake than leave lifeless in a body bag ” . following his logic , kevin seems to imply that if one does not treat officers with respect fatal violence is to be expected . maybe it ’ s even justified . i realize that ’ s probably not what he meant to say but that ’ s what his logic implies . again , what about the respect officers should have for the citizens they are paid to protect ? as far as i know , police officers are sworn to protect and serve , not to inspire fear . they should have a duty to respect the freedoms of citizens , not to violate bodies whenever they are challenged . obviously , the situation changes when citizens are claiming the freedom to take away other citizens freedoms but i ’ m mostly speaking of unwarranted arrests here – such as the “ countless times ” kevin was pulled over . thirdly , what is most hurtful about his post is that kevin seems to be victim blaming . he seems to suggest that if some people had not been resistant , they would have been fine . sure , i believe that some who died during confrontations with the law contributed greatly to the escalation into fatal violence and therefore to their own demise . however , some recent victims complied and still died by the hands of law enforcement . officers should be prepared to deal with disrespect and overall resistance in a manner that forces compliance but not injury – and definitely not unnecessary fatality . basically , what kevin is saying comes down to this : ‘ you want to continue breathing a little while longer ? do as the cops say . if you don ’ t , you are willingly putting your life on the line . so don ’ t be dumb ’ . is that really what interaction with the police should be like ? lastly , kevin states that police officers have only one goal : to get home safely after their shift . why does it sound like this was written by an officer of the law , expressing affection for his fellow colleagues and heart for the profession ? anyway , is that really their one and only goal ? if so , why be a police officer ? that goal would be much simpler to achieve as an accountant . surely officers also have a goal to protect civilians and to ensure fellow citizens can safely roam the streets . but how does one procure safety ? well , one obvious way is to neutralize danger . but how does one recognize and estimate danger ? my guess is , based on one ’ s subjective experiences ( including training ) , based on dominant cultural notions , based on human instinct such as the recognition of the danger of unfamiliarity . this leads me to argue that an african american confronted by a white american officer , especially one who is unfamiliar with african americans , is at a certain disadvantage compared to his fellow white american citizen . the greater the perceived danger , the higher the risk of escalation ? maybe . if african americans are perceived as more dangerous , why is that ? probably because of negative perceptions , fed by dominant cultural notions , which can only slowly change through societal evolution . these things take time . however , right now , we are aware of these psychological , cultural and social pitfalls but not enough is being done to prevent these perceptions from leading to unnecessary deaths . that is all part of the tragic aftermath of these tragedies . to return to kevin ’ s post , i think he is dead wrong if he thinks that not everyone would like to make it home safely . nobody is out to get hurt . if i give him the benefit of the doubt , i could say that he meant that if everyone did everything in their power to return home safely , the world would be a different place . still , like i said , some of his logic has outrageous consequences . this left me wondering . who is this kevin martin ? and so i looked up his facebook page but that wasn ’ t very informative . his oldest post dates back to february this year , which makes me question the authenticity of his profile but i can ’ t really support that claim with any hard evidence . i did a reverse image search but came up empty . so if it is a fake profile , someone went out of their way to cover up their tracks . all i know is that kevin ’ s post , massively shared through blue lives matter , is shamelessly reinforcing – and advocating for – the safekeeping of the status quo and therefore i felt the need to debunk kevin ’ s statements . i would also like to add that i bear no particular ill will toward police officers , i believe most of them do their best to protect citizens . however , i ’ m slightly allergic to posts promoting their perfect altruism . just like many other professions conferring power , it can get dangerous when that power is exercised by an immoral person . i have to say that i do believe that a lot of the people who shared kevin ’ s post did so because they thought they were making a positive contribution to a situation that is spiraling out of control . others may have felt the media — and myself as well — are ignoring the perspective of officers of the law . i think they were trying to show that things could be different , that things could be better and safer for everyone , but by doing so they ignored all the objections i described above . in conclusion , i do not believe that kevin ’ s post describes how things should be . not at all . he unknowingly described most of what is wrong and loathsome about the current state of affairs . and these types of statements , ignoring legitimate concerns , will not help to improve the situation . they stand in the way of progress , as they endanger the opportunity for peaceful conversation . people who value the police ’ s indispensable work should voice their support while acknowledging the serious flaws in what some described as `` going by the book '' . as bill maher stated , if that type of behavior is by the book then “ maybe you need a new book ” .",medium_antiracist

 1 .   offensiveness is in the ear of the hearer , not the mouth of the speaker .   if you do n't care about which words bother other people , then by all means say whatever you want .   just do n't be surprised when other people make assumptions about you based on your speech . 

 2 .   i 'm not sure who 's telling you that you ca n't use certain words .   you can use any words you want .   and , again , people will form opinions about you based on what you say . 

 3 .   a hell of a lot of what bothers ~~people~~ me about certain words are the associations they have .   in the case of that old favorite , "" nigger "" , it is typically associated with two kinds of people : black folks who have "" reclaimed "" it , and who are usually using it without malice .   sometimes they are using it maliciously , and in those cases , it 's offensive and pretty shocking .   for example , see the character of uncle ruckus on the tv show boondocks . 
   the other group of people who frequently use it are , you guessed it , proud bigots . 

   people can tell if you 're black by looking at you .   so if you 're not , and you use the word "" nigger "" , people are likely to assume you belong to the second group . 


 i guess the part that i do n't get is where you say "" using the word "" nigger "" or other "" racial slurs "" without the intention of offensiveness "" . 

 why in the world would you want to use these words if you do n't intend offensiveness ?   are n't there other words that are more universally palatable that would still get your point across ?   if you do n't want to be taken as racist , why the heck would you want to talk like one ? 

 to me , the whole "" it 's unfair that white people ca n't say this word "" argument sounds like the whinging of a spoiled child .   is n't being white awesome enough ?   do n't we have enough privileges that we can afford to give up this one ?

 well , at least it used to be , but that 's racism with a big r , and a lot has changed these past 40 years . when we hear talk of ' racisms ' such as in this article what we 're witnessing is an unconscious cultural shift by whites to intellectually dominate the arena and thereby drown out protests against white supremacy . there 's nothing technically wrong with the idea of ' racisms ' of course , but it 's a word derived from a language that has an important history in the war against white supremacy which has to be respected , because the consequences ( of its casual usage ) on historical works against racism are proving to be detrimental . [ it 's a hijacking in fact ; the stealing of a word ( that others have made powerful ) for the sake of its power , but the only reason this word has such potency is because of its historical understanding in the context of white supremacy . ] 

 white supremacy , it seems , needs to be exposed and laid bare once more ( redefined even ) if the word racism is going to be used in such a way . 

 "" ... how is it that we have the audacity to hijack the word [ racism ] that gave racially oppressed people the power to identify and target their oppressors , or rather the very source of their oppression , and use it ( if we so wish ) against them in the name of fairness and equality when the very thing that word was used to identify still oppresses them today ? "" 

 "" ... instead of trying to even - out the playing field so that we can tackle racism on - the - level and understand it as a white bias ( retaining its historical meaning ) , we find ourselves attempting to even - out the rules of racism and interpret it as we please : as an equal bias with equal consequences . "" 

 "" any advances that have been made are gradually being eaten away because we are losing sight of what racism is ; because it is no longer recognised for what it is . we seem to be in a situation where white people are seeking equality for themselves in racism , attempting to persuade everyone that we are equally discriminated against rather than acknowledging the obvious white biases at play in society and their disproportionate consequences .

 step 2 : enter your zip code ( plus the 4 - digit extension ) into [ this website ] ( for those who do not know , the 4 - digit extension should be separated from the zip code by a single dash ( i.e. xxxxx - xxxx ) . 

 step 3 : enter their last name in your search bar , followed by "" .house.gov / contact "" . so , for example , if my representative was senator jane doe , her contact page would be at "" [ doe.house.gov/contact ] ( if this does n't work for whatever reason , then you 'll have to navigate their website to find their contact page manually . simply type "" contact jane doe "" into your preferred search engine , and you should be able to find it pretty easily .

 you certainly understand that no matter how hard you try you have internalized racism that may never escape . i can see a little of it in the poem . even as you try to recognize the cost of western luxury through the diamond ring , as /u / deshypothequiez mentioned , you portray your internalized connection between african children and starvation which you do n't necessarily know is true . not every child in africa live in dismal situations . even for those that are , many people who study globalization would argue that people who work in below - first world standard conditions would be far worse off if they did n't have jobs . point is , you ca n't really know anything about peoples ' situations unless you have literally been in their shoes . likewise , second to last line , "" and you have got work to undo "" makes it sound like you feel you can remedy the injustice in the world . the intentions are good , but the message sounds like that of a "" savior . "" 
 
 none of these things make you a bad person or even a bad ally . i 've felt the same as you have on many of these issues . you just have to keep learning . i 'd start with a book called invisible man by ralph ellison which explores the many different kinds of allies and their failures . 

 before that , watch [ this speech by the late david foster  

 i hope you can see how his message relates to your current situation . it 's easy to judge and hate people in your suburban community . it 's harder to see how everyone generally has good intentions and have complicated lives . but , your next few months will be easier if you do . this ability to think , after all is what ends racism itself . to see and treat people of color as true equals is a challenge for white people , no matter how hard it is for us to admit it . to ' think ' in the way wallace asks is what allows for our internalized prejudices to escape . so the last thing i want to tell you is do n't be angry . i could sense this what you feel . only a generally angry person would make the title of their poem "" fuck your white face .

” when susan , don , and becki , three longtime colleagues and equity-focused educators , read the article , we decided to further the conversation and propose five guiding principles for educators who share our will and ongoing commitment to make fundamental changes in the educational system . 1 . acknowledge reality . admit to ourselves that school systems are not safe places for students of color and speak out when we see injustices . recently , a six year old orlando girl was handcuffed and arrested , sparking outrage . yet , countless incidents exemplify the inequitable treatment of black and brown students who are suspended and expelled at much higher rates than white students for the same infractions . the “ pipeline to prison ” starts with schools that feel like prisons with metal detectors , security cameras and locked gates . a 2019 study revealed that over 75 % of schools in the us are segregated in racially concentrated districts . unequal conditions impact achievement for students of color through lower funding , less qualified teachers , and a lack of resources including counseling , mental health support , and access to high level coursework . timothy jenkins of teaching for change told the washington post , “ our youth must be exposed to the facts about america instead of the myths . they need to put law enforcement in context and understand that police are doing nothing more than following the dictates of society — which is to protect privilege and property , not individual rights . you have to know what you ’ re dealing with before you can change it. ” educators also need to become cognizant of these facts . just this week , while don was teaching his graduate level social justice class , several students sought his advice on what they could and should do about teacher colleagues who they believe exhibit implicit bias toward students of color and treat them unfairly . confronting colleagues , and having hard conversations about perceived bias , is never risk- free but always the right thing to do . for too long , far too many of us have looked the other way when injustices were apparent . we must directly confront that which we know or perceive to be wrong . don advised his students ( all teachers ) , “ do not ignore your moral compass ! ” staying quiet is not acceptable ! open conversations about the realities of racism and bigotry with staff and students . 2 . examine our own identities and our mindsets , reflecting on implicit and explicit biases . understanding our beliefs and behaviors opens pathways to compassion for our students . ask questions like these that susan uses in her teacher preparation course to self-examine deeply held beliefs about identity : staying quiet is not acceptable ! we can unearth and address implicit and explicit bias and learn about and increase acceptance of our own and each other ’ s social identities . 3 . keep the global wellbeing of students at the heart of schooling . shift the paradigm from students as vessels to be filled with knowledge to students as multifaceted people . focus on educating the whole child . that means creating a positive climate that affirms all students ; using effective instructional strategies ; providing individual support based on how each student learns ; and attending to social and emotional needs , prosocial development , interpersonal skills and their overall physical and mental wellbeing . staying quiet is not acceptable ! take action for learning and belonging . 4 . counter societal stereotypes and use anti-racism resources and materials . staying quiet is not acceptable ! take action to help students fight racism and be upstanders . 5 . examine your school . how are students of color being treated ? what are their academic and social outcomes ? protests have called for police departments to dismantle and completely restructure systems of policing . across america , communities are starting to shift funding away from policing to human needs . additional funding is critical to eliminate funding inequities especially in communities with many students of color . but that is insufficient . we need to restructure our entire educational system to eliminate opportunity gaps and meet every student ’ s needs . start small and go big . one school examined their homework policy and found research showing it minimally affected achievement.they changed their policy . another school reviewed data on the popular robotics program , discovering the majority were white because the feeder schools with mostly black and latino students did not offer necessary prerequisite coursework . they then instituted a summer course to prepare students for the program . in each case , these processes led to changes that positively impacted students of color . staying quiet is not acceptable ! start working to redress institutional inequities . what will it take ? we now ask each educator to return to the question : what will it take for us — no matter what role we play in education — to speak up , to contribute to educational equity and commit to ongoing work ? we can not stop because it is too uncomfortable , nor allow ourselves to think if we do not talk about it , it will go away . it will not go away . we can not stop because we are overwhelmed by the enormity of the task . we can not lose hope . now is the time . staying quiet is not acceptable . quiet is not peace ! this article was co-written by susan charles , don cox , and becki cohn-vargas susan charles ed.d. , has over 30 years of experience as a teacher , counselor , and administrator in k-12 education and over 15 years in higher education . originally from the island of dominica , she also works with schools in india , china , the bay area , and has worked in the caribbean and africa . donald cox , m.p.a. , writes and teaches graduate–level courses at notre dame de namur university to aspiring administrators , facilitates “ online ” school leader support groups , and coaches teachers and principals .. his thirty-five years in public and private education have focused on equity , principal leadership and effective communication , social-emotional learning , and lgbtq issues becki cohn-vargas , ed.d. , is a consultant and the coauthor of identity safe classrooms , k-5 ( corwin , 2013 ) and identity safe classrooms : grades 6–12 ( available in august , 2020 ) . becki has worked as a teacher , principal , curriculum director , and superintendent in urban , suburban , and rural communities . her website , beckicohnvargas.com , features additional blogs and films .",medium_antiracist

"" its a privilege to be that carefree and naive . non - white people in nyc do not have the privilege of that carefreeness in their lives . its discrimination against black people sure , but the privilege that is experienced by white people is the tangible thing that white people can identify in their own lives and we must point out to them that that privilege is only afforded to them because they are white . if its not pointed out , then they will continue to be passive about the lack of privileges their minority co - workers , friends , family etc face because they wo nt realize that in fact , they have something we do n't because in their minds , everyone has this privilege . pointing out that its white privilege shoots reality of being a poc at them .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_67935,"i 've been around city politics long enough to know how deeply it affects your life . local politics are more important to you than federal politics . that 's true in the us and almost anywhere that government functions are n't completely controlled by the state . while this article does n't specifically talk about ways to combat racism in politics , it does highlight the reasons you need to be involved in local politics in order to combat racism on the local level . 

 take , for example , programs like ice partnering with local police departments to run people they take to jail through the ice database . a single vote on the city council may be enough to block or overturn the program . or local protests staged in front of city hall . it may not end ice , but it will sure hamper them . 

 another policy you can have an impact on is housing and zoning . these rules are often how communities keep out people of color or limit them to living in certain areas . 

 another matter of local policy is which streets have money spent on them . that 's not just things like maintenance , but upgrading them and beautifying them . 

 other ways you can impact city policy other than running for city council is to serve on one of the citizens ' advisory boards ( contrary to the name you do n't have to be a us citizen , just a citizen of the city ) . everyone who lives in the city has a say in how the city runs through these boards . but they usually turn out to be the same people with time and money who are already deeply embedded in the business and politics of the city . an example of why you should join say , the library board is that you get to talk about what the library 's priorities should be . does your population need more internet access ? spanish language materials ? family programs for immigrants ? late material policies that do n't punish the poor ? it 's up to you to decide . 

 now state politics may or may not be more relevant to your life , but things like the expansion of medicare are up to the states , as well as what textbooks to use and whether to oppose or support federal marijuana laws . or whether they 'll oppose plastic bag bans and city sick leave ordinances like texas does . so that could be a level on which to fight racism . still , i 'd say local ordinances and policies are more relevant to your daily life . 

 this is a short and incomplete list of the ways in which local governments affect your life , but believe me , it 's a longer list than you 'd think . i 'd really suggest looking into your local politics .",reddit_antiracist

 race is culturally constructed . therefore , to the extent you are perceived as not - white ( which varies on cultural context , as your experiences demonstrate ) , you are not - white . 

 i do n't think you need to be concerned about ' playing the victim ' . your experiences validate that you are perceived as not - white . even if they did n't , race is culturally constructed , which means that it is performed . you can , then , perform race even if you are not culturally codified into the race you have chosen to perform . there are a lot of questions about authenticity that go into the idea of performance , but we can sidestep those as well since you are culturally codified as not - white . 

 i think performance might also be a way to address some of the issues you seem to want to address ; namely , given the background above , you seem to be asking , how should i live my life ? performance allows you to identify yourself as you choose . surprisingly , barack obama 's book * dreams from my father * is interesting on this point . the book can be read as a * bildungsroman * in which the character barry discovers his racial identity . i 'm sure there are other books on this point , but obama 's came to mind .

reddit_antiracist_22918,"* more radicalized , at least for me",reddit_antiracist
reddit_antiracist_86078,"people fear political correctness because they see it as an assault on free speech . 

 not only that . but people see it as an assault on their thought processes . basically they see "" political correctness "" as a way that "" liberals / the state / society / whoever "" are trying to shape public opinion and thought . in that way something they say is "" not politically correct "" such as espousing a racist belief ( i.e. blacks are inferior because they commit more crimes per capita than other races ) is actually speaking the truth to the source of power in a society which is trying to hide social problems under the guise of political correctness . 

 in other words . for the example i used above , the politically correct thing to say would be that their are higher rates of crime among the african american population due to opportunities denied by a racist system ( such as denying people the gi bill or other govt benefits that whites got [ before the modern era of welfare that we easily think of ] or being forced to live in certain areas , or being forced to attend sub - par public schools etc . ) and that because of this their social cohesion as a group has suffered and with few access to opportunities crime is one way that a member of this group can support himself or herself . 

 someone who does not share this view ; someone who as a "" politically incorrect "" view would say that the reason that there is higher crime among african american populations is because they are naturally more violent than other races . some might even go so far as to endorse oppression due to such a belief . however , they believe their belief that blacks are naturally more violent to be the correct one . thus , when someone gives the "" politically correct "" version of why crime rates are higher ( which i tried to briefly do in the previous paragraph ) this politically incorrect person would see that as an attempt by society / the government to rephrase the debate and as an attempt to force racial harmony and an attempt to end racism which they think either does n't exist or is warranted based on the actions and behaviors of certain races . 

 in shorter words using this example : those who complain about political correctness think that being "" politically correct "" is a way to gloss over the real issues that exist in an attempt not to offend people . thus , many people who have these views enjoy moments when they can be around people that share them because they can talk about how such - and - such a group ( african americans for instance ) are naturally violent or otherwise inferior without fear of reprisal from someone saying that what they are saying is incorrect . this is why they say "" political correctness hides the truth "" . because in reality the purpose of being politically correct is to end racist language and thought . unfortunately the racists think they are right , and because of that find the idea of "" political correctness "" to be restricting and a limitation on their freedom as individuals within social situations . 

 or . at least that 's how i understand it as a 21 year old white male college student who sometimes has interactions with people that think i share their racist / sexist viewpoints .

medium_antiracist_47695,"teaching lessons of white supremacy in prime-time : blackrifice in the post-apocalyptic world of the cw ’ s the 100 the main problem with the cw ’ s the 100 is a reliance on blackrifice to advance the motivations of the white characters in the narrative . so , in the 100 , the earth has been devastated by nuclear war . 12 space stations that were orbiting the planet came together , voltron like , into one huge station in the aftermath . life on the huge station is harsh , with all crimes being punishable by death- unless you ’ re under 18 , in which case you ’ re imprisoned for an indeterminate amount of time . after 97 years , the people in charge in the station decide to try to test the survivability of the landscape on the planet post-nuclear war and send down 100 ( see ? ) of the young prisoners to act as canaries . early on in the first episode , we ’ re introduced to the main characters . they include : clarke , the main character , a blond haired , blue eyed young woman . bellamy , the bad boy , a dark and handsome type . finn , the archetype of every college sophomore white guy who wants to change the world ( seriously , he ’ s insufferable ) . and wells , the son of the chancellor , the ruler of the remnants of humanity . also the only black character of the 100 with more than a line for approximately eight episodes . of the titular 100 , two facts stand out . they ’ re overwhelmingly white . and they ’ re overwhelmingly good looking . wells , the aforementioned only black kid with a line , is quietly in love with clarke . but her heart , of course , belongs with finn . the idea that the cw would pair the white , blond , female main character off with the dark african american character seems like it was always a non-starter for the show . and so it is , for the first three episodes , that clarke and finn run around the landscape , have sex , have adventures , etc , while wells stays behind and off camera for the most part . this ends abruptly as wells is killed off at the end of the third episode . wells ’ death is used , of course , as a means for the white characters to ruminate on their society and capital punishment . that ’ s pretty much it . wells is blackrificed to further the storyline of his white compatriots . but wait ! there ’ s more . now , one of the other two black characters is wells ’ father , chancellor jaha . let ’ s take a moment to understand that in the world of this show , the only two black characters of note from space are related . jaha is up on the station , relegating him to a supporting character ( the appeal of the show for the cw ’ s demographic has got to be the promise of a world without parents ) . he is the leader of his people and does leader things , like giving cliched inspirational speeches and getting exasperated with his subordinates . eventually , in order to make the first season ’ s penultimate episode have some dramatic heft , the station becomes unlivable due to the machinations of ellen tigh and its inhabitants are forced to flee . in order to do so , the stations have to decouple from the main hub . of course this all goes very wrong and someone has to stay behind to hit the release button and then die , slowly . so who makes this sacrifice ? one of the 1000s of people left on the station ? nope . chancellor jaha . yes , he blackrifices himself so that the remaining people on the station can live . i don ’ t know if the show was going for some asinine captain goes down with the ship shit here , but man… all the other characters of color are either comic relief for the kids or the mysterious , tribal “ grounders , ” a tough and savage race who managed to survive the nuclear holocaust . they , unlike the “ good guys , ” or the kids from the ship and the people on the ship , are not majority white . one of these supporting characters , called lincoln ( of course ) , acts to move the story along by acting as the savior of supporting character octavia . presented initially as a wild , dark man , he eventually shows that he knows english and acts the part of noble savage . lincoln continues to throw himself in harms way to protect the white adventuring kids . that ’ s pretty much his role . attempted blackrifice . oh yeah , then he introduces the clarke to the leader of his people . who is also a blond haired white woman . the 100 is a well done show , for what it is . don ’ t get me wrong . but the continual misfires , intentional or not , are creating a show that seems more interested in maintaining an old culture while telling the story of a new one . it ’ s no surprise , really , that people of color feel that they have to start movements to assert the value of their lives . when our culture teaches teens subtle lessons in white supremacy like the 100 does , the value of black life is eroded by the time they reach adulthood .",medium_antiracist

 the law is a document that can be read in multiple ways and enforced in thousands of ways but must be interpreted and enacted by people .   if we had robots interpreting and enacting the laws there might be no prejudice but instead we have people whom see with unspoken and unnoticed biases that see two people who have done the same crime with the same criminal history but are of different races getting vastly different sentences for their crime . 

 this has cascading effects that affect income potential down the line as well as political engagement and thus disengages citizens , that prisons claim to rehabilitate , from society .   not to mention the fact that the initial recording and adjudication of crime may have been guided and shaded by the prejudices of either the investigators , the victim , or even the judges and jurors themselves .   there are many cases in the us where people convicted are exonerated by exculpatory evidence after serving decades in prison , some even on death row . 

 people are not perfect and can not discriminate fairly .   we say justice is blind , but the fact is that until you blind the enactors of the entire justice system , the enactment of law is discriminatory and systemically racist .   i am assuming discrimination is inherent and i think you should too , unconscious bias tests are easily available and startlingly revealing too even for the most "" woke "" individuals , i previously included myself in this group .

medium_antiracist_4344,"moving while black : intergroup attitudes influence judgments of speed the journal of experimental psychology recently published an article exploring the relationship between intergroup attitudes and perceived motion . in the article , kenrick et al note that most experiments on the relationship between race and perceived threat collect data from subjects looking at static images . the authors argue that understanding motion perception in interracial encounters is extremely relevant to everyday life , considering that we live in a dynamic world in which all interpersonal interactions involve at least some movement between the involved parties . studying motion perception can provide us with information relating to a person ’ s affective state , social category membership , and intentions . as such , the kenrick et al decided to explore the effect of motion perception on interracial encounters by considering whether interracial threat shapes the speed with which white subjects judge black people . their main hypotheses were that white people who feel anxiety around black people might experience subjective time expansion when black people appear to be approaching , and that this experience of time expansion when viewing approaching black people will lead threatened white people to perceive black people as moving more slowly compared with their experience of white people approaching in the same manner . the first experiment used faces taken from stimuli developed for the implicit association test and presented them on a computer screen to white subjects . the size of the faces were manipulated to create the perception of movement toward the subjects . following each face , the participants rated the speed of approach on a likert-type scale ranging from 1 ( very slow ) to 8 ( very fast ) . after this section of the experiment , participants completed the intergroup anxiety scale to measure interracial threat . kenrick et al found a reliable interaction between these two types of measurement and concluded that as intergroup threat increased , black targets were judged as moving more slowly relative to white targets . this interaction stayed significant even when the study was conducted in person by a white female experimenter . to test the hypothesis that white people high in intergroup anxiety will not perceive receding black faces as moving more slowly compared with white faces , participants completed the semantic self-assessment manakin ( which measures affective reactions ) as well as the intergroup anxiety scale before being shown receding faces on the computer . kenrick et al found a significant three-way interaction between intergroup anxiety , target race , and direction of perceived motion . consistent with experiment 1 , as intergroup anxiety increased , black forward-moving targets were judged as moving more slowly relative to white targets ; however , this was not case with backward-moving targets . kenrick et al ’ s final experiment tested whether intergroup anxiety would be associated with perceiving time as passing more slowly when participants judged moving black faces , which would mediate the relationship between threat and speed ratings . they were successfully able to replicate the findings of experiments 1 and 2 — as intergroup anxiety increased , time seemed to pass more slowly when moving black faces relative to white faces . the slowing bias found in this study is consistent with reports of time expansion by people who have experienced threatening events . the findings are also consistent with the idea that receding threats are less worthy of attention than approaching threats , which explains why the slowing bias was not present with backward-moving targets . it would have been interesting if the experimenters had asked participants to complete harvard ’ s black-white attitude implicit association test as part of their study . this test attempts to uncover implicit race preferences that people are either unwilling or unable to properly report to experimenters . although the majority of white respondents show a preference for white faces over black faces , black americans are split 50–50 between preference for white and black faces . since kenrick et al used stimuli designed for the iat in their study , it might be worth conducting the experiments with black subjects ( rather than exclusively white subjects ) and exploring the relationship between scores on the black-white attitude iat and the difference in speed with which participants perceive motion black faces versus white faces . kenrick , andreana c. , stacey sinclair , jennifer richeson , sara c. verosky , and janetta lun . “ moving while black : intergroup attitudes influence judgments of speed. ” journal of experimental psychology : general 145.2 ( 2016 ) : 147–54 . web . https : //implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/canada/background/faqs.html",medium_antiracist

 i am from america .    i did n't ask to be born in america .   i just was .   let 's say i was at one point a pretty impoverished person in america and it really sucks to be impoverished .    if i went to someone from eh , sierra leone who is also impoverished , and i said , "" i can relate to your situation i know what it is like to be shitted on , i understand ... "" the fact of the matter is i would still know what it is like to be american , and being american and poor is simply different from being from sierra leone and poor . 

 likewise , if a really wealthy person of color ( parents are millionaires , grew up a millionaire , drives a bling car ) went up to a poor white person and said , "" i understand what it is like to be poor because i am a poc "" i 'd highly doubt that person 's credibility .   dude understands what it is like to be discriminated against for his skin color but not by financial status . 

 that being said , lastly ... just a thought on "" understanding "" and "" i can understand ... "" 

 it is n't up to us to decide whether or not we can understand someone . 

 it is up to the person we are trying to understand to decide whether or not we truly understand them . 

 if that individual or community decides whether that we in fact do not understand then , then that is their call , that is their say ... only the person "" being understood "" can confirm whether or not the understanding actually happened .  

 i used to really rail against this , like how dare you tell me i ca n't understand , that 's insulting , that 's demeaning ... but i think once you do that , you 're not trying to understand at all .   you 're arguing and insisting that you do understand and all that is reinforcing is how much you do n't get it .

medium_antiracist_26609,"does it matter who is in the white house ? or is there something in our system which would force any president to act as obama ? up until this election , i would have said there is something systemic , at least since the neoliberal shift in the dems post-mcgovern , and probably further . but the modern election cycle sure looked a lot , to me , like it hadn ’ t changed much in 50ish years , other than republicans going further and further off the rails post-southern strategy . what we ’ re seeing now is new , though , i think . trump would never be allowed as a serious candidate before ( and we have seen from his previous attempts ) , but the southern strategy has come home to roost and a scared , authoritarian group has come to rule enough of the gop that trump has become inevitable . on the other side , sanders is a viable candidate . he ’ s not exactly socialist , and by the standards of 60 years ago would be a a bit left of the republicans , but after the great neoliberal shift , he ’ s further to the left than anything i would have said could be possible . while there are constraints on the potential powers of a president trump or president sanders , in terms of getting through the inevitable do-nothing congress , in terms of grass-roots politics , they ’ d both provide an incredible mandate should they be elected ( and , one hopes in the case of sanders , even if he ’ s not elected ) . in that sense , for the first time in my life , it does seem to matter . how serious is the problem of debt ? the problem of poverty ? it is one of the most pressing problems of our time , and of all time . debt and serfdom are the same things with different colored leashes . no one collects billions of dollars in order to buy necessities , or even luxuries . i don ’ t even think it ’ s useful to think of wealth at that level as “ money ” since it ’ s not used the same way us plebs use it . rather , extreme wealth seems to be a way to quantify power and control . it allows you to “ buy ” politicians , media , schools , technology , prisons , etc. , to support your ideology and further increase your power metric . poverty is the flip-side of this coin . poor people have little choice but to engage in the system that disenfranchises them , doing its bidding . the fewer the safety nets , the more desperate the situation , the more we are all forced into labor not of our choosing . much of that labor is creating things almost no one needs ( and often wouldn ’ t want except for the ideology we ’ re trained in from birth ) . the only people who need those creations really only need to make sure we ’ re all employed , even if uselessly , in order to ensure people are beholden to them for survival , so they can be used in power games ( e.g. , privatize your water supply or we ’ ll leave , and you ’ ll lose 10,000 jobs , devastating your community ) . what is the meaning of the split between the administration and the american intellectuals ? intellectuals have a long history of being , overall , leftist and anti-authoritarian , which is contrary to the goals of capitalist ideology . is white america committed to granting * equality to the black american ? i can only assume this is a joke . of course not , and it never has been . all important movements towards black emancipation have happened on the backs of black people and against the furious opposition of white people . while a few white people have always been around as allies to black emancipation , i seriously question whether they were at all necessary . mostly , to my eyes , they keep getting pointed out in order to allow white folks to score points and pat themselves on the back . the recent fervor among white sanders supports over his arrest picture is a case in point : it seems to be little about sanders ’ beliefs , whatever they might have been at the time , and more to be about two unrelated things : self-congratulatory rhetoric for supporting one of the “ good guys , ” and trying to brow-beat black people into supporting sanders . where do you think our foreign policies are likely to lead us ? where they are currently leading us . the chickens are coming home to roost . as the empire crumbles and contracts , the excess military are going to come home in the form of people , hardware , and policies all with the intent of dominating domestic policy and violently crushing dissent . meanwhile , the human toll from our foreign policy has created a globe that , at best , can only be described as hating us , and in many more desperate parts , wants to destroy us , and is having less and less trouble finding recruits in that mission . back at home , domestic terrorism will continue to rise , in order to fight back at institutions that have become more nakedly pro-capital and violent in their defense of that . of course , i suppose you could say things like the homestead massacre are domestic terrorism , but for some strange reason it ’ s never described that way . what in , in general , do you think is likely to happen in america ? increasing factionalization as security decreases . violent oppression by government and private security forces . increase in underground/black market trade for essentials as the wealthy begin to horde , flee , and bunker themselves . it ’ s going to get ugly , and once it starts it ’ s all going to fall apart very quickly . the only question is when that inflection point happens . do you think any promise is to be found in the activities of young people today ? very much . this is the first generation of young people that seem to have lost enough hope in the american political process to start looking for solutions elsewhere , by growing their own politics from the ground up and eschewing corruption by the old guard ( who , of course , claimed to be doing the same thing as hippies , but mostly weren ’ t ) . i can easily see those same local , grass-roots organizations turning into the essential means of survival as the larger political and social edifices ( dependent as they are on cheap oil , an ideologically-aligned populace , and threats of starvation ) crumbles . in the hippy era , building a tribe/commune was about making a political choice and opting out . now it is not a choice and it will be about survival , and the youth of today that ’ s building those communities and learning those skills will be the ones to carry us forward into whatever happens post-empire .",medium_antiracist

 1 . humor ( quotes from popular stand - up like chris rock , louis ck ; off - color jokes that belong in /r / wtf or /r / imgoingtohellforthis ) 

 2 . seemingly benign confessions ( "" i do n't hate black people , just black culture "" ) 

 3 . rational approaches , like statistics or "" scientific "" findings . ( the "" black people commit more crime "" statistics gets thrown around a lot ) 

 all of these approaches serve to make the average redditor reading these comments more comfortable with idea of racism . when they find themselves in an environment where their peers ( people they identify with and find witty / funny ) basically admitting they do n't like black people , the idea becomes more appealing , and if you already have some doubts or preconceived bias it 's only going to be strengthened by these users .

reddit_antiracist_90976,"grade inflation is a legitimate problem , and has roots in greater institutional problems . graduate programs all have minimal requirements and more and more jobs are requiring bachelor degrees . this means more people are attending college and receiving bachelor 's degrees than ever , which deflates the value of a bachelor 's degree and forces students to focus solely on grades in order to compete . people are more concerned with requirements than merit in this case , which defeats genuine academic inquiry . 

 i can only back up my statements with anecdotal evidence , but i have not found it to be the case that african - american students have minimum grade requirements because of scholarships , although i 've had many white students come to me and express worry about their grades because of minimum requirements in fraternities and sororities ( which , at least at my institutions , are dominated by whites , though whites do not comprise a plurality of my institutions ) . and again , i 've never had an african - american student ( or from any other non - white group for that matter ) suggest that i was a racist for my grading policies , although i have had white students make that claim . 

 the other major problem with grade inflation is no child left behind , which has very little to do with race . my students who have come in in the last three or four years ( who basically came up under nclb ) ca n't really write , and freak out if you give them an exam that is n't multiple choice . i teach history , which is pretty pointless without essays and class discussion ( which recent students also do n't quite grasp ) . furthermore , because the onus of proving failure is on the teacher , it 's rare that students ever come up against serious grade challenges until they actually get to college .",reddit_antiracist

 > ask a local surfer in manhattan beach about “ the incident ” on presidents day , and people will know exactly what you ’re talking about . it started as a normal south bay outing for justin “ brick ” howze and gage crismond , two friends who have been regulars there since they started surfing together eight months ago . they made the trek from hollywood . did the dance of getting into their skintight wetsuits as the sun rose . waxed their surfboards while blasting music in the parking lot . 


 > the waves were n’t that great when brick , a 24 - year - old musician , producer , creative director and dj , found himself in the middle of a couple of traffic collisions in the water . first , a surfer dropped in on brick ’s wave , resulting in brick ’s board thrashing the other surfer ’s board . the second time , it was brick who accidentally cut someone off . “ get the f — out of the way , ” the surfer told brick . an argument ensued . 

 > . 

 > as emotions climaxed , a different surfer — white and older — inserted himself into the fray . he began calling brick the n - word repeatedly . then he called him a “ donkey ” and violently splashed water in his face . he also called gage , a 25 - year - old dancer and choreographer with painted nails and arms full of scribbly tattoos , a gay slur and told him to “ go back to the streets . ”",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_18979,"leading through learning one step at a time , i want to learn how i can best support and lead through this racial crisis . i want to be part of the solution , not a silent bystander . today , i participated in several twitter chats that discussed the racial crisis occurring right now in our country . this crisis has been something that i have not really been able to capture in words . as i watched the news and the coverage of the protests , i knew that i needed to do something more , but i honestly didn ’ t know what that was . on tuesday , allyson apsey posted an amazing blog post on her blog , serendipity in education . in this post , she discusses how as a white woman , her life has been given privileges that she doesn ’ t fully recognize but that she wants to do better . she pledges to do better by reading a book a month to help her better understand racism . she invited others to join her in this 12 month journey . when i read her post , it spoke to me . since 2020 began , i have been reading every day to learn . having read 24 books so far this year and counting , i realized that not one of them dealt with the topics of equity and racism . as i looked at her graphic , i realized this would be a great place to start . i went on my kindle and downloaded i ’ m still here — black dignity in a world made for whiteness by austin channing brown . before reading it , i have to admit that i was nervous taking this risk , but i didn ’ t know why . but as i started reading it , i couldn ’ t stop . reading austin ’ s story , i was enthralled . at first , i started making some connections to her struggle relating it to my struggles as a jewish american woman . but then , it hit me . all of my life , when anyone asked about my race or culture , i would identify as jewish . i would identify as being part of a minority group . it wasn ’ t until i read this book that it hit me . what i thought of myself was irrelevant in many ways to the rest of the world , because from a distance , anyone who passed me would say that i was white . i , too , had benefited from white privilege . i know this seems like a simple truth , but it shocked me and made me want to learn more . as i looked through my facebook feed , i came across a youtube video that one of my twitter/facebook friends in my pln had shared . i met traci browder last year in a # pd4uandme chat . we became friends in late 2019 after we realized that we shared a lot of the same goals for 2020 . in her video , traci shared her reactions to this crisis and her experiences as an african american , a mother to two black sons , and a wife to a black man . i watched her video transfixed as tears fell out of my eyes . as she shared her story , i realized that the struggles and hardships she shared were ones , as a white woman , i had never even considered . my heart went out to her and i wanted to send gigantic hugs from virginia to her in texas . it was an amazing video and if you haven ’ t watched it yet , you should . a few days later , another touching video came across my facebook feed . in this post , jeff gargas , from the teach better team , shared a youtube video from maurice martin called “ color blind — we need to talk. ” his story touched me as well . the more i learn , the more i find that i need to know , need to understand . this led me to participate in several saturday morning twitter chats , including # leadlap , which was facilitated this week by my friend , traci browder . this chat was probably one of the most inspiring chats that i have ever participated in . educators from around the county shared how they were feeling during this crisis . they shared how they were learning to lead through this crisis . they shared what questions they had as they navigated this hard work . as i participated , i realized that i was not alone in the hard work that i need to do . seeing others who were as motivated to begin as i was inspired me . afterward , i sent traci a direct message thanking her for the chat . she shared that it wasn ’ t easy for her either and i once again sent hugs her way . as part of the # leadlap slow chat this week , traci asked us to share these thoughts . she asked us what was stirring in us or weighing on us . she wanted us to think out loud : what will we commit to learning ? i want to learn more . i want to listen more . i want to hear others ’ stories . i am committed to not only building my own self-awareness of the white privilege that i have , but awareness of the struggles that others endure . that is my first step in this hard work , but i know that this is just the first step and not the solution . one step at a time , i want to learn how i can best support and lead through this racial crisis . i want to be part of the solution , not a silent bystander .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_38266,"oh , so this is what ya ’ ll mean when you say hip-hop is the only culture or , what ’ s ok for them is not okay for us i have my wind-down websites . after a long day , i like to settle in to a little nymag.com , some engadget , and a little wired . what i really gaze at to slow my brain down though is sneakernews . release dates , colorways , special editions , all just words since i ’ m no “ sneaker head. ” i ain ’ t never waited in a line for shoes and i ’ ll be damned if i pay anymore than the retail price for something . but every once in awhile , i click on the site and i can feel my blood broiling . seeing shoes that used to cost $ 54 now being priced at $ 150 is annoying but it doesn ’ t anger me . if khadijah can sell her used “ 54.11 '' reeboks to some eager collector for triple the original price — go ‘ head , sis . i ’ ll tell you what pisses me off . anytime i see a shoe or a service provided by a large company that resembles something that we thought up when we were kids — something that was once shunned but now celebrated as genius — that gets my temperature rising and my fingers ’ a typing . nike id ? we fantasized and talked about the possibility of such a thing back in the mid-80s , coloring our shoes with markers was the closest we could do . but what really set me off…puma + coogi collabo shoes . all the things we once did in attempts to be different , to stand out , are now being repackaged and sold back to us at exorbitant prices . that part sucks , but what sucks the most is that we cool with it and drop down our hard earned $ s on this knockoff shit . so let ’ s talk about these damn pimps for profit and where they got their ideas from . you may not remember the pre-jordan world . in that world your choices were white , black , blue . those were solid colors . if you wanted two colors — white with a red symbol , white with a blue symbol . that ’ s why people loved the suede puma jawns . you could get maroon , white formstrip , blue , white formstrip , black…you get the point . so seventh grade , 84 , we learned the hard way , once you made an attempt to customize a pair of white/grey puma , trying to get them to match your jumbos ( some people called them fat laces ) , you only had one customization and that was that . that grey formstrip ain ’ t going back to grey once you colored that thang maroon . i ’ m talking about me . i did that . the seventh graders of falcon court north thought it was fire . my dad thought , “ you won ’ t be getting any more shoes to ruin. ” which was fine with me — i started customizing shoes , $ 5 a pop . seven customizations meant a new pair of shoes ( though i never dared to do that ) . started out simply coloring adidas stripes and puma formstrips ( nobody wore nike ) . that advanced to me writing people ’ s names in their formstrips — that was $ 7 . by the eighth grade , i just did the designs and people would get them airbrushed on . for $ 10 , i would make designs for the shoes and sweatshirt or jacket . i got lazy in high school and stopped my side hustle . i incorporated my customization in my drawings . at first i was moved by the shirt kings artwork that i saw ll rocking , but the end of my freshman year/sophomore year — that ’ s when i became truly inspired . up until my freshman year , luxury to me was twill lee jeans . twill cost almost ten dollars more than regular jeans but for all the different color options…it was well worth it . but as soon as crack hit ( the east coast ) , rappers began imitating their local drug dealers and italian luxury brands became staples . we inherited that obsession as we discussed here from watching music videos . after seeing the “ i ain ’ t no joke ” video , me & sayyed munajj searched far and wide , from the tivoli to the tabor center to tamarac square in hopes of finding a gucci pouch . ( note : that pouch is only seen for two , maybe three seconds ) as 87 rolled into 88 , we started seeing all types of louis vuitton , gucci , fendi and mcm apparel . i ’ m talking jackets , hats , coats , pants , suits . not only did we see this apparel in music videos , we saw it on album covers , and in the rare rap magazine features . i know i ’ m not alone when i say that i thought that these companies made all of this apparel . everything looked so well-made and official , how could it not be authentic ? right ? wrong ? dapper dan got them benjamin button genes . i swear he looks younger today than he looked it in those old photos of him posed with all the rappers of the first “ golden era ” of rap . he doesn ’ t look like a man who had his lucrative business crushed by licensing police and corporate lawyers . he must not be nostalgic , living in the past . he must not be a bitter man . especially considering the fact that dapper dan was almost 30 years ahead of his time…well…not really . but we ’ ll get to that . open 24 hours a day from 1983 to 1992 , dapper dan ran a business like no other . his business was catered to his buyers whoever they might be . and there were different kinds of outfits . some were the ever-popular luxury brand cuts while others were my favorites — the rapper/athlete specific cut ; i ’ m talking the salt n pepa , bdp jawns . those were the outfits that inspired me and made me long to have a set made for our crew . while both quick , ( bored ) in-class drawings have customized outfits in the vein of dapper dan , the one to the left has my own shoe design , not so uncommon among many of us who drew or made characters . that was the power of dapper dan , his clothing made countless young , rap fans dream of being designers , creating the clothes and shoes that we wanted that no company would ever make . around the time dapper dan opened up his shop , bronx native , sonia sotomayer began work at pavia and harcourt with a concentration on intellectual property litigation — her focus — a fendi anti-counterfeiting campaign . it was this campaign that led the future supreme court judge to dan ’ s 125th street haberdashery . together with heather “ dragon lady ” mcdonald , sotomayer sought out counterfeit goods from chinatown to uptown . sotomayer was famous for vesting up and going on raids and seizures with officers in support of the trademark counterfeiting act of 1984 aka 18 u.s. code § 2320 . according to harper ’ s bazaar , “ intellectual-property theft , the business of counterfeit and pirated goods , is an estimated $ 600-billion-a-year global industry that costs legitimate u.s. businesses up to $ 250 billion a year in lost revenue. ” and while they may have been true of the counterfeit purses and wallets in chinatown , it hardly had anything to do with the work that was done by dapper dan up in harlem . it wasn ’ t as if someone could get anything dan made at gucci ’ s 685 fifth avenue flagship store . nonetheless , the first raid took place in 1988 . with guns drawn , officers and sotomayer burst in dan ’ s shop and confiscated the leather swaths that were used to make dan ’ s creations . dapper dan reportedly refused to show in court and those items were destroyed . after four years of raids , one of sotomayer ’ s last acts as a private attorney before becoming a judge was her 1992 case against dapper dan which ultimately led to the closing of his harlem store . as corny and funny as the ape ” was , when i first saw the supreme x louis vuitton collabo back in january , i wanted to summon him to the fashion show to threaten models on the runway and scare vuitton designer , kim jones , out of the building . but ‘ the ape ’ was washed in one of the most comical , non-blow landing jumpings of all time and the fashion world went on to celebrate the supreme/vuitton collection as “ surprising ” and “ exciting. ” all i could see was the hypocrisy . sure , vuitton once hit supreme with a cease and desist order back in 2000 . and sure , vuitton never sued dapper dan . so where is the hypocrisy you might ask ? for me , it ’ s a hypocrisy that ’ s pretty widespread and something that we discussed in “ negros need not sample. ” when a young , paper thin white woman matches designer brands with popular sneakers , she ’ s celebrated for knowing “ how a pair of nike airmaxes can be worn with a céline coat and a chanel bag. ” something that black women ( black american , dominican , puerto rican ) have been doing for decades , a style andre harrell dubbed “ ghetto fabulous ” and was popularized by mary j blige…who debuted in 1992 . i love that term , columbusing , you know , when white folk recognize something that ’ s existed for eons and claim they discovered it . check out this statement : allow me to translate : streetwear , as propagated and worn by niggers , a couple of years ago , was this thing ( emphasis , my own ) that high fashion wouldn ’ t touch . now because young white girls and boys are taking on this look these two disparate worlds are overlapping more than ever . or check dominic chambrone , also known as the shoe surgeon . he ’ s celebrated for “ remixing ” and customizing shoes , often for star clients and i have yet to see any cases of him receiving cease and desist notices or copyright infringement suits . here ’ s one example of his work : hey…isn ’ t that gucci ? when chambrone ran into trouble with pendleton he simply explained that he was doing one-offs…and they were “ kind ” enough to say that if he ever went into production that they would pursue legal action . wasn ’ t dapper dan ’ s entire business one-offs ? and that ’ s why seeing that puma x coogi propelled me into writing more than a tweet . didn ’ t lebron james just commission the nike bespoke ’ s rocky xu for these to be made : i mean…a few months ago . now puma ’ s mass producing the same damn look just on their iconic clydes ? they couldn ’ t even be original enough to use one of their modern shoes . “ lebron customized the iconic a1 , we ’ ll customize our iconic shoe , too. ” had to be puma ’ s creative director thought . in the world of hip-hop before it was hijacked by the rap industry , that kind of thing was an absolute now cipher . the culture was once— be original at all costs . that ’ s the mind that introduced the world to different brands and styles and sounds . “ oh she ’ s rocking prada ? i ’ m gon na get with chanel. ” “ everybody ’ s wearing puma , adidas , wait until i break out the le coq sportif , the diadora , the lotto , etc. ” it ’ s bad enough that we ’ ve become a culture of imitators , that we don ’ t mind sounding exactly like the next man or woman . that sucks for the music . but what sucks more is now the fashion , television , & music industry has caught wind of this and learned how to monetize it . which wouldn ’ t be so bad if we were allowed to live in a world where we could be our natural , creative selves . instead , our creativity is either mocked or worst , criminalized all the while what we do is celebrated when it ’ s done by white people . and we think that shit is hot ? and we throw them our hard earned cash ? it don ’ t make no kinda country sense . when skaters decided to voice their disgust with supreme thinking that the company was pulling away from the original vision of anti-establishment . supreme responded like this : skaters have it twisted . james jebbia created his company in a world of pnb , triple 5 soul , phat farm , etc . supreme was always jebbia ’ s interpretation of that…that of course , is black culture which began to be expressed in what was called streetwear . “ the culture ” that jebbia ’ s talking about is the one that marc ecko ’ s made his fortune off of and is the same culture that ’ s been robbed since we were first abducted from our various countries . so when people talk about hip-hop culture is “ the only culture , ” what they ’ re really talking about is black american culture ; a culture that we ’ ve always been ashamed to live , a culture that we now have fed back to us and sold at a premium price…and somehow , it ’ s supposed to be better now . it ’ s not okay to me and i ’ m gon na talk about it as long as allah blesses me with fingers to type and a mouth to speak . a taste of dapper dan ’ s work : we like our clothes more royal-looking than the laid-back look of gucci or fendi . their clothes are too bland . dapper dan streetwear a couple of years ago , maybe even as recently as three or four years ago , was this thing that high fashion wouldn ’ t touch . now , these two kind of disparate worlds are overlapping now more than ever . lawrence schlossman throughout the history of the brand , we ’ ve seen our customers have apprehensions whenever we do something unexpected . however , we have always stayed true to the culture from which we came . supreme",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_8817,"the difficult heritage of british colonialism it is possible , if you follow me on twitter , that you will have seen me get my 140 characters in a twist about this article in the telegraph . i am in no way the target audience for the telegraph , so maybe i brought it on myself , but then i realised that this piece was a symptom of a narrative thread running through the current discussion of cultural heritage in the united kingdom . it ’ s a thread i like to call : colonial blindness . as a nation , there seems to be a trend towards conveniently ignoring the horrible crimes of the british empire . perhaps it is because we are not taught our own international history at school , perhaps it is because people in charge of such things , like michael gove , refuse to remove their rose-tinted glasses . unfortunately , some of these said people are the ones influencing the management of , and legislation for , the protection of the united kingdom ’ s cultural heritage . the telegraph article was based on comments made by philip davies , a former english heritage director . one of the things i find most concerning about this article is the utterly concrete belief that the government should invest £2million in an initial feasibility report into preparing conservation strategies for these buildings , so that we can charge in and save the day with some heritage-led urban regeneration . the very idea , unfortunately also supported by lloyd grossman of the heritage alliance , is deaf to its own white saviour overtures . “ listen to us , do what we say , look after these buildings the way we tell you and just see how you can benefit from our skills and knowledge . one day , you could be as skilful and knowledgeable as we are , but only with our help. ” philip davies believes that we should , true to historical form , crusade across the open seas to save the crumbling relics of our colonial past . he believes that we , as british citizens , have a right to preserve these monuments on foreign soil because we were responsible for putting them there . he couches it in terms of “ shared history ” and “ promoting britain abroad , ” but it seems to me a transparent and sickening scramble to revive a victorian pride in a map heavily shaded in red . i believe that these buildings should be part of history . they have a story to tell . their fabric should be recorded and their history explored . they should be documented in ways that will assist scholars , present and future , to explore the architecture of a colonial society , and its social implications . what happens to that building fabric , however , is the sole decision of the governments that own it and the citizens that live with it . it is not ours . it never should have been ours . they were built by force and suffering , and we should not seek to shine and polish these trophies of past atrocities . reading author ’ s photograph of the parthenon marbles at the british museum © 2013 “ the uk experience in urban regeneration could help to safeguard this unique shared heritage generating jobs , skills and prosperity for the city , and opportunities for british cultural exports. ” “ i claim india for britain ! ” “ you can ’ t claim us , we live here , 500 million of us ! ” “ do you have a flag ? ” “ we don ’ t need a bloody flag , it ’ s our country you bastard. ” “ no flag , no country , you can ’ t have one . ”",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_84515,"i think two separate points need to be distinguished here .   1 ) practically speaking , the ad is like an ad for pizza hut about celebrating your italian heritage .   this ad would be stupid because pizza hut is not an italian - american company ( i assume ? ) and it does not sell italian food .   if you were italian american , you would not order pizza hut when you wanted to celebrate your heritage .   even if you are not italian and/or ca n't make italian food , you would go to an italian restaurant to celebrate italian food .   likewise , if you want to celebrate african - american heritage by eating soul food , you would not go to kfc . 

 but this is all a practical issue about how this ad is awful .   so far , it 's not really "" racist , "" just culturally clueless and seemingly unaware of what the african american culture / food is ( or else comically ambitious about overselling what kfc is ) . 

 2 ) where things take a darker turn is that this ad does not exist in a vacuum .   the pizza hut ad would be mostly comical .   this ad , taken in the context of the hurtful stereotype that "" black people love fried chicken , "" appears to be saying that african american cuisine is not a bona fide style of food , but a bucket of cheapo fast food fried chicken .   this is surely not what the ad - makers intended to convey , but nevertheless it reminds the reader of racist comments they have heard about fried chicken and appears to endorse them -- implicitly blaming the reader if they have been offended by fried chicken comments in the past because they should be taking pride in the rich part of their heritage that is eating kfc .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_83194,"i know somewhat of what you 're going through . majority of my friends are white as well , and i 've been lucky enough to have one of my best friends , who is white , be able to explain things to other white people . nevertheless , there is a time when i have to speak for myself . 

 first off , it 's not fair to give your friends ultimatums like that . you 're not their parents , guardian , or someone who is in authority over them . you are their friend , and they are your friend . giving advice and suggestions is one thing , but telling them what they have to do or the other is beyond your reach . like the others have said , you ca n't tell other people how to live for you . do n't make your friends choose , because you might end up losing . 

 having said all of that , you do need to let you friends know that his behavior is unacceptable . you 're right , they do n't understand , and maybe they never will . racism is a huge thing for you , and you have to decide whether or not you want to continue to be with these people . we make friends with people who are similar to us , and the fact that they hang around and condone what he says without trying to correct what he says should speak volumes to you . just like you ca n't control your friends , they should n't try to control him , but if they do n't let him know that his behavior is not acceptable then that means that they think it is ok . 

 if you decide to continue hanging out with them , and you happen to be in a position that you 're around him or some other openly racist you need to handle yourself better . you said you 're 20 , hopefully going to turn 21 one day so that means you 're getting older . you have to learn how to handle yourself as a young man because people are going to try to provoke you , and a racist will say that you behaved that way because you 're black but not because you were provoked . to be honest , that 's probably what this guy was doing before . he wants a reaction out of you , and you ca n't give it to him . now if he attacks physically then defend yourself , but if he 's just using words to mess with you , you got ta learn to control your anger , be witty , and be the better man . defuse the situation , and remain cool . that 's the best advice i can give you . good luck , and keep me updated .",reddit_antiracist

 personally , i find this sort of academically - motivated reshuffling of terminology to be a boundary to effective communication . instead of getting to the heart of difficult conversations , now people are forced to discuss what words mean before a dialogue can even begin . and at worst , if they do n't have the foresight to ensure everyone understands everyone else 's definitions , they could actually end up fighting over something they actually agree about , because a loaded word means something very different to both parties .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_51363,"is this trying , see photo of i and my wife as member 's of the bahai faith which says this ; "" behold a beautiful garden full of flowers , shrubs , and   trees .   each flower has a different charm , a peculiar   beauty , its own delicious perfume and beautiful colour .    the trees too , how varied are they in size , in growth ,   in foliage — and what different fruits they bear !   yet all   these flowers , shrubs and trees spring from the self - same   earth , the same sun shines upon them and the   same clouds give them rain .   	 

 so it is with humanity .   it is made up of many races ,   and its peoples are of different colour , white , black ,   yellow , brown and red — but they all come from the   same god , and all are servants to him .   this diversity   among the children of men has unhappily not the same   effect as it has among the vegetable creation , where the   spirit shown is more harmonious .   among men exists   the diversity of animosity , and it is this that causes   war and hatred among the different nations of the   world .   	 

 differences which are only those of blood also cause   them to destroy and kill one another .   alas !   that this   should still be so .   let us look rather at the beauty   in diversity , the beauty of harmony , and learn a lesson   from the vegetable creation .   if you beheld a garden in   which all the plants were the same as to form , colour   and perfume , it would not seem beautiful to you at all ,   but , rather , monotonous and dull .   the garden which   is pleasing to the eye and which makes the heart glad ,    53 is the garden in which are growing side by side flowers   of every hue , form and perfume , and the joyous contrast   of colour is what makes for charm and beauty .   so   is it with trees .   an orchard full of fruit trees is a delight ;   so is a plantation planted with many species of   shrubs .   it is just the diversity and variety that constitutes   its charm ; each flower , each tree , each fruit , beside   being beautiful in itself , brings out by contrast the   qualities of the others , and shows to advantage the   special loveliness of each and all .    

 thus should it be among the children of men !   the   diversity in the human family should be the cause of   love and harmony , as it is in music where many   different notes blend together in the making of a perfect   chord .   if you meet those of different race and colour   from yourself , do not mistrust them and withdraw   yourself into your shell of conventionality , but rather   be glad and show them kindness .   think of them as   different coloured roses growing in the beautiful   garden of humanity , and rejoice to be among them .

 also , the hong kong protestors are protesting against an entire government , one that is a lot more shady and totalitarian than ours .    although the blm movement as a whole is meant to combat the institutional racism that allows for police brutality against black people , higher incarceration and death penalty rates , and suppression of social mobility , i feel as if a lot of people are still in the mindset that the protests and the pain will be over when the 4 cops are arrested . there is n't a cohesive mindset of all the protestors , just because the protests have n't been going on that long and people are still learning about blm . and since the beijing government is super fucked up , the hong kong protestors have to really watch what they put online and how they organize these protests since there 's the risk of disappearing off of the face of the planet , so people who are learning about these protests are most likely very dedicated to the movement and have a lot of experience . 

 at least that 's my take . if these protests and rallies continue for the rest of the year , we will definitely see a lot more organization and hive mind behavior .

 you 're absolutely right , hence my comment about characters being integral to the show .   i got no problem with those .   but you have to admit that when a black character is on the show just for the tokenism , it 's sort of a slap in the face . 

 if i ca n't relate to a show , i just simply do n't watch it .   but i do get your point in letting the creators know . it 's just that i feel that many of them go the tokenism route as a response just to appeal without actually putting some serious thought into the character , which only makes it worse . 

 some of the best examples of excellent black roles are in sci - fi shows . some of my favorite shows had black characters that were not just for show , but were actually important characters to the theme of the show , and that 's why i loved them so much .    not only that , but it was something i could relate to .   from star trek to stargate , i was pretty happy that there were characters i could relate to . 

 i recognize shows for what they really are .   they are just to appeal to the demographics , especially the ones that the studio 's ' perceive '   as the ideal market for whatever is being advertised .   if they want to base this on race , then that 's on them .   but their shows wo n't get my viewing if i ca n't really relate .

reddit_antiracist_66548,"oh i 'm not just hinting it , its a well known fact of medicine , except the term poc is restrictive , in reality even within large populations sorted by skin color there are subpopulations that contain variations in snps that can spectacularly affect their predisposition for disease . 

 one of the most obvious examples is the gfr scale used in american hospitals used to measure kidney function . african americans are rated on a separate scale because their blood contains higher levels of creatinine than people of other backgrounds . a creatinine clearance is used to determine kidney function ( it is very low in patients with stage 5 renal failure ) , and african americans need a separate scale in order to avoid being miscategorized in terms of renal function . 

 countless examples in the literature , in india there is a subpopulation in the north called the vysya who have a mutation in their cholintesterase ? gene that makes it so that they can not recieve succinylcholine as an anaesthetic during surgery - as it would kill them .

” with all due respect charles , your need to shape the world in your neo-liberal image in public forums from which i have no escape , is the source of my exhaustion . i had already figured out ways to cope with the world i ’ d been presented with . i ’ d already made it out of the metaphorical cave . now all i can hear are the screams and whining of everyone else from inside . the echoes are deafening . even my main man jon stewart devolves into discussions about the difference between calling this a terrorist attack versus a tragedy , an issue of gun rights and mental health , to talking about how crazy racist it is in south carolina . jon stewart has done amazing work . everything he ’ s done in his work on the daily show is par excellence . he outshines many of his peers in journalism in his candor and tact when dealing with similar topics . and even his voice is too damn loud . his voice is the best voice , but when i finish watching videos like the one above , all i feel is a resounding desire to say “ duh doi ! ” welcome to the world homie ! this feeling is a difficult one to communicate . historically when i ’ ve expressed this feeling it hasn ’ t been well received . here ’ s perhaps a more concrete example also mined from my personal experience . i have really terrible hearing , clinically so . my left ear is bad enough i had to sit in front of the class all throughout school otherwise i ’ d have trouble hearing what the teacher was saying . i can always tell if i ’ ve got the right/left headphones in the wrong ear . if i can ’ t see someone ’ s lips when they are speaking i have trouble understanding them and i can ’ t hear whispers at all in my left ear . my whole life is influenced by this simple fact . when people of all creeds and backgrounds learn about this they are shocked . they will make conscious efforts to favor my right side , they will cite me as their hard of hearing friend , and post very in depth articles on social media about how best to care for your hard of hearing friend . they are my ally . they are also seemingly appropriating my experience for their own authenticity grab . now i recognize that no one is doing this on purpose , i know that people honestly want to tell their friends and make sure that everyone they know is aware as possible . the only people that are unaware , or are in need of this being an event are other people of priviledge . i don ’ t really imagine waking up to a world in which a white friend alerts me to something new about my own experience of blackness , in the same way i don ’ t expect someone with perfect hearing to illuminate the specifics of my struggles with sound . i don ’ t have any other way to describe the way i have been feeling the past few months as anything other than triggering . there is a lot of noise , and instead of making me feel better and supported i feel the exact opposite . i feel as though everyone wants a piece of my pie . people are using up a disproportionate amount of my outrage . people have even succeeded in making me feel guilty about not feeling bad enough when things like this happen , not realizing that this is happening to me . i am the victim . i ’ ve been shamed for not being shocked or surprised as to how shitty it is to be black in america as if i didn ’ t know . so thats all i have to say . i ’ m tired . being in the world with this skin is tiring . hearing from other people who don ’ t share my experience of how shitty the world is is tiring . seeing the only depictions of people who look like me in the media as negative or dead is tiring . i suggest we all just take a nap . bigotry and hatred aren ’ t going anywhere . it will still be here when we get back , but for my sake let ’ s all just shut up about it for a minute . * * * i recognize how ridiculous/hypocritical it is to write an article basically saying how much i hate all the articles related to current news events . this was more of an exercise in putting my feelings into writing and adding another black voice into the mix . hopefully in doing so i can help other folk who feel the same way * * * * “ what happened in a charleston church on wednesday night is a lot of things , but one thing it ’ s not is ‘ unspeakable. ’ we should speak of it often . we should speak of it loudly . we should speak of it as terrorism , which is what it was . we should speak of it as racial violence , which is what it was. ” charles p. pierce in esquire",medium_antiracist

 but i had some general comments about race in hollywood in general .   like a lot of people , i enjoy tv and movies and always perplexed at how little your see people of different races represented .    we heard from two different star directors that said they would n't get funded or the big movies would n't sell in foreign markets if they had a mixed cast , this is from george lucas and ridley scott .   but the interesting thing for me , but when do you see   a "" mixed cast "" in any top movie ?   you could name any movie of the week and the cast and predominantly white .   the martian ( matt damon ) , the intern ( anne hathaway and robert deniro ) .    you see an occasional black role , not in the main actor / actress and not in the secondary cast but some random extras role .     and they always set these films in two or three locations , new york or la or sf .   and somehow there are no black people ever around to get focus .   my take on sf and la .   sf had a very strong asian community , japanese , chinese , korean ... everywhere .   hanging out in mission district ( my fav spot ) , you get a real cool diverse vibe from the city .   but that is n't necessarily represented in film .   and nyc we know has its diversity .    and you have the tv show girls tv show , a show about female new yorkers ... relatively few minorities shown ( as one example ) . 

 and i kind of wonder , why ?   it seems bizarre for our artists to focus on this one particular group which does n't necessarily represent america .   and even if the art does n't represent america , try it out , mix up the diversity in film .

reddit_antiracist_81913,"young black male from new york . do i speak for anyone else ? ca n't really say . but there are some differences between racism on the internet and in real life . 

 just to jump into this quickly , racism on the internet is emotional and blatant . and when directed at an individual , mostly anonymous . and for me personally , while it is frustrating and annoying , is easily forgettable . do you think i can recall all the times i 've been called the n - word on xbox live ? no . plus i often have the means to block out the sources of it ( avoiding certain subreddits , for instance , muting everyone in a video game lobby ) . 

 racism in real life is more subtle . most of the time it 's ingrained into aspects of your life that anyone who had n't experienced it probably could n't understand . for instance , when i go into the city to hang out with friends , maybe i have to take a second when i 'm picking clothing , because i do n't want to give a cop an excuse to stop me or some shit . i have to worry about the impression that i give to white people just from my sheer existence . i think the majority of white people never have to have an equivalent thought , while the majority of black people have to have that thought . 

 sometimes with real life racism , it 's so casual you wonder if it 's actually even happening ... you start wondering if you 're crazy for thinking something is racist , or you wonder if it 's unintentional . [ watch that commercial . ] ( it 's for frosted flakes . black father and daughter , they run out of frosted flakes and play a game of horse for the last bowl ? are you kidding me ? look at that house ! i think they can afford to buy a new box ! and at the end of the commercial there 's that pound to just hammer home the racism . 

 another thing about real life racism that i think that commercial also serves to illustrate - other ( white mostly ) people think they have the right to tell you what you can / should think is racist or not . i believe that commercial is racist . others would say no it 's not , or no you 're overreacting / you're just being overly sensitive . how can you tell me what to feel about something you 've never truly experienced for yourself ?

reddit_antiracist_76230,"the term white to refer to europeans began in 17th century america during the racialization of slavery and the rise of racism . the idea of racism or racial superiority was n't really practiced until about this time . before that it was more class structure . at that given time , the opposite of white was not black , it was colored ( think of a piece of paper ; if it is not colored then it is white ) . by the late 17th century , more spanish and french immigrants started coming through and the name was then changed to negro meaning dark ( hence where the term darkie comes turn from ) . that was later bastardized in the mid 18th century from negro to nigger ( which was absolutely meant to be derogatory but was so commonly used it became their name ) . skip ahead a few centuries and you come to the early 20th century when the first generation of non slave negro americans , whose parents were also not slaves , move toward equal rights for voting . it is at that time they started referring themselves as being to the opposite of white people and started calling themselves black . white people in the early 1940s i want to say , changed what they called them back to being negro or , more politely , colored . but the term black was meant to mean angry or strong or something to be feared , so that 's why they adopted it . much later , it was very difficult to say whether someone was black or white by classification because someone from india could be seen as being black even though they are not . in the same way someone who is black could have very light skin and be considered white . so in the late 1970s , the term was changed in order to be inclusive to a particular group of people and called them african american . soon after , all of the other races also took the suffix of american . so now you have african americans , asian americans , middle eastern americans , and so on and so forth . the reason that white people are still referred to as white as because since everything else is classified white remains its own classification . hope this helps :-)",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_40285,"misunderstanding terrorism : exposing radical caucasian extremism five days after the horrific oct. 1 massacre in las vegas that claimed 58 lives , authorities in north carolina thwarted an early morning bomb attempt inside a regional airport that presumably could ’ ve killed and maimed dozens . the alleged bomber was identified as michael christopher estes . in an interview with federal officials , estes allegedly made clear his motivations for planting the homemade bomb inside asheville regional airport : he was preparing to “ fight a war on u.s. soil. ” luckily , no one was harmed inside asheville . the “ war ” estes was allegedly getting ready to fight never materialized . typically with any terror attack on u.s. soil , there ’ s wall-to-wall coverage on network broadcasts . these reports invariably detail the devastation that unfolded and the heroics of first responders , followed by insidious speculation over how the attacker ’ s religious beliefs or political views served as a motivating factor . alas , this scripted narrative seemingly always unfolds when the purported attacker is identified as a muslim . in the haze of a sudden attack , we ’ ve also seen a desire by journalists to advance these talking points , despite the absence of factual reporting . on many occasions , this occurs when the media is quick to presume muslim violence — the most glaring example being the boston marathon bombing in 2013 . for whatever reason , the foiled plot to bomb an american airport did not generate the same standard deluge of press coverage . actually , it ’ s quite possible that most americans are unaware that this bust — and its potentially catastrophic and lethal devastation — even happened , or was a possibility at all . it ’ s surmisable that coverage of this incident would ’ ve likely been far more extensive if the attack was successful . it ’ s also completely surmisable , given the aforementioned track record , that the national media would no doubt have devoted more resources to investigate the person ’ s background et al. , had the attacker been muslim . since the sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , conventional wisdom holds that muslim extremists pose the biggest threat to national security . trillions have been spent in securing american interests abroad and at home and waging the so-called war on terror . secret surveillance has become an ubiquitous law enforcement tool , and innocent muslim americans have been spied upon by the nypd at mosques , at work , and other establishments . multiple congressional committees have held hearings on the threat of islamic extremism , including a series of sessions before the house homeland security committee that began in march 2011 under the leadership of then-chairman rep. peter king ( r-ny ) . king ’ s politically-charged hearings coincided with an emotional debate over a proposal to build a mosque and community center in lower manhattan . even at that point — a decade after 9/11 — muslim americans expressed that islamophobia was even worse than in the early months after the attack . anti-islam rhetoric has persisted , but it reached a fever pitch during the 2016 presidential campaign , when then-candidate donald trump said he believes “ islam hates us ” and called for a ban on all muslims entering the country in response to the deadly 2015 san bernardino shooting , which left 14 people dead . after trump was elected , he signed multiple executive orders banning travelers from muslim-majority nations from coming to the united states , near-instantaneously sparking massive protests at airports across the country . in actuality , there was already a costly and ineffective post-9/11 travel registry system that collected the information of tens of thousands from 24 predominantly muslim countries , plus north korea , but it failed to even uncover one terror plot , and was discontinued in 2011 by the obama administration . in an era defined by the need to respond vigorously to extremist attacks at home and abroad , officials sought to combat the spread of dangerous ideology with a program called countering violent extremism ( cve ) . created by the obama administration , cve sought to better understand both islamic and right-wing extremism , and develop ways to prevent people from being radicalized . although some muslim americans embraced the program because the government appeared to welcome feedback from prominent members of the community , others saw it as furthering the stereotype that muslims are inherently at risk of radicalization . among cve ’ s most significant shortcomings , critics say , is its emphasis on deputizing members of local communities to single out possible bad actors . this type of suspicion facing muslim american communities became so widespread that muslim advocacy groups wondered why right-wing terror wasn ’ t receiving equal scrutiny . the actual number of attacks perpetrated by so-called islamic extremists and right-wing extremists suggests a disproportionate amount of funds and attention is directed at the former , when right-wing zealots have carried out even more attacks in the united states since 9/11 , killing roughly the same amount of people , according to the government ’ s own figures . from sept. 12 , 2001 through dec. 31 , 2016 , right-wing extremists carried out 62 violent attacks , killing 106 . at the same time , the 23 incidents attributed to islamic extremists led to 119 deaths , according to the non-partisan united states government accountability office . up until the summer of 2015 , deaths caused by non-muslims in extremist attacks dwarfed those in which muslims were fingered as the perpetrators , 48 to 26 . according to data compiled by the investigative fund at the nation institute and reveal from the center for investigative reporting , there was a combined total of 115 successful and foiled right-wing plots between 2008 and 2016 , one-third of which were thwarted . during that period , there were 63 cases of islamic domestic terror . it ’ s no wonder then that muslim americans often cringe when there ’ s word of another mass shooting or terror attack in america . on the occasions when the violent offender is a white male , what muslims notice is an attempt by some in the media to either humanize the attacker or question their mental stability , said mehdi hasan , a host on al jazeera english and contributor to the intercept . “ it ’ s become a joke in the muslim community . it ’ s become a meme online when a white , far-right terrorist [ attack ] happens we all joke : ‘ when is he going to be humanized ? when ’ s he going to be given a ‘ mentally ill ’ excuse ? ’ ” hasan tells news beat podcast . “ clearly that is what you might call white privilege , ” he adds . “ the idea that if a white person carries out an act of mass terror it must immediately be excused , indulged , explained . he must be humanized . there must be a mental illness problem , and therefore terrorism becomes a redundant word . terrorism becomes not an act of violence committed for political purposes against civilians , which is one definition of terrorism , it becomes really an act of violence carried out by a brown muslim dude. ” charles kurzman , professor of sociology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill and co-director of the carolina center for the study of the middle east and muslim civilizations , publishes an annual report at the triangle center on terrorism and homeland security of islamic extremist attacks in the united states . what he often finds is the number of deaths associated with extremism are always far eclipsed by the overall murder rate in the country . kurzman ’ s most recent report analyzing murder data from 2016 found that islamic extremism-inspired attacks represented one-third of one percent of all murders in america that year . yet the prevailing collective wisdom for years now in america has been that terror , specifically so-called “ islamic extremism , ” poses the most serious threat to public safety . in his most recent report , kurzman ’ s colleague at the triangle center on terrorism and homeland security , david schanzer , called it “ flatly untrue that america is deeply threatened by violent extremism by muslim-americans. ” kurzman chalks up the fervor over islamic extremism to fear rhetoric and concerns that there ’ d be “ waves of 9/11s coming our way , ” after the initial attack in 2001 . although that hasn ’ t been the case , kurzman notes that the government hasn ’ t “ recalibrated our sense of threat. ” “ the islamic state , for example , did pose a threat for a time . fortunately , that threat is much diminished now , ” kurzman explains . “ but even at its peak we were talking about lone individuals , or a couple of individuals , with very low-tech types of attacks , such as knives , personal arsenal , driving on sidewalks to run people over . these are not the scale of attacks that we feared might occur after 9/11 that would replicate the scale of the attacks on that horrible day . we just haven ’ t seen that level of sophistication and coordination , and yet the institutions we set up to protect ourselves from that large-scale type of attack are still there today. ” when kurzman and schanzer published a survey of perceived threats from law enforcement agencies nationwide , they found that the national narrative over islamic extremism was out of touch with the most serious concerns of local agencies . “ in a survey we conducted with the police executive research forum last year ( 2014 ) of 382 law enforcement agencies , 74 percent reported anti-government extremism as one of the top three terrorist threats in their jurisdiction ; 39 percent listed extremism connected with al qaeda or like-minded terrorist organizations , ” kurzman and schanzer wrote in the new york times . “ and only 3 percent identified the threat from muslim extremists as severe , compared with 7 percent for anti-government and other forms of extremism. ” “ these officers , selected from urban and rural areas around the country , said that radicalization from the middle east was a concern , but not as dangerous as radicalization among right-wing extremists , ” they added . kurzman and schanzer weren ’ t alone in that conclusion . a separate study conducted by national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism at the university of maryland in 2014 similarly found that four of the five most serious perceived threats by law enforcement came from right-wing groups . leading the way was the sovereign citizen movement , followed by islamic extremist and a trio of far-right groups . the most notable right-wing attacks in recent memory — the mass murder of nine african americans at mother emanuel a.m.e. church in charleston , s.c. by white supremacist dylann roof in 2015 , and the slaying of 32-year-old heather heyer as she protested a neo-nazi march in charlottesville , va. this year — are outliers in that they both generated an overwhelming sense of horror . charlottesville , in particular , forced many americans to look inward at the dangers of right-wing terror . the chilling scene of mostly white men hoisting tiki torches and chanting “ you will not replace us ” as they marched on the streets of a virginia college town was evidence enough of insidious anti-semitism and racism that exists in america today . then one of the protesters decided to crash a car into a group of counter-protesters , killing heyer . while president donald trump insisted that both sides were to blame for violence that broke out that day , other government officials decided to take action . in late september , federal law enforcement officials appeared before the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee , and were asked about the right-wing threat facing americans . “ i don ’ t think many americans understand the level of threat that we have in this country from white supremacists , anti-government and other violent extremists , ” said sen. claire mccaskill ( d-missouri ) . she proceeded to discuss the number of people killed by right-wing extremists since 9/11 , citing the government accountability office ’ s findings . the same report , which was released before the charlottesville attack , also found that deaths in right-wing extremist incidents “ exceeded those caused by radical islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years ” after 2001 . ( the gao generally defines violent extremism as “ supporting or committing violent acts to achieve political , ideological , religious , or social goals. ” ) “ we ’ ve had multiple hearings on the threat of isis as it relates to homeland security , ” mccaskill added . “ we ’ ve had zero hearings about the threat of domestic terrorists and the threat they pose in our country and our response to it. ” mccaskill asked fbi director christopher wray for a breakdown of his agents investigating international terror versus terror coming from white supremacists and anti-government groups . wray testified that he “ agreed ” that the domestic terror threat is “ a very very serious one , indeed , and something we spend a lot of time focused on ” but he couldn ’ t provide an allocation of agents . in his own research , kurzman came across an fbi report from about a decade ago that listed approximately 7,000 agents assigned to counterterrorism duties , with only 335 of those dedicated to domestic terror . despite the limited roster of those investigating home-grown terror , those hundreds of agents were making “ far more arrests per agent than the 95-percent who were devoted to foreign , international terrorism , the bulk of which is directed at muslim extremists , ” explained kurzman . of wray ’ s response to mccaskill , kurzman said : “ i can ’ t wait to hear what that number is . and i hope that that number reflects the actual rate of domestic terrorism in this country. ” sammy rangel is not shy about discussing his troubled past . the former right-wing extremist now finds himself on the side of those trying to do good , by offering guidance to others consumed by hate . having lived that life , rangel is not one to judge . “ i think what drives us is our sense of duty , our sense of service to kind of unravel some of the hate that we ’ ve created in this world , ” rangel tells news beat podcast . “ but also we feel like today we bring something to the table that is meaningful so we can leverage that experience when necessary but we also know that is not the only defining factor of who we are and what we ’ re doing. ” rangel is the co-founder of life after hate , a nonprofit striving to help rehabilitate people who lived a life of extremism . as long as there is empathy and compassion in the world , he doesn ’ t believe anyone is beyond salvation . he ’ s come a long way . rangel spoke with news beat at the nonprofit women ’ s islamic initiative in spirituality and equality wise up summit in washington , d.c. , which marked the culmination of years of research and the publication of an extensive report challenging misconceptions about islam and how extremists use a perverted interpretation of the religion to corrupt the minds of impressionable and sometimes disenfranchised youth . [ listen to a special backbeat episode recorded at the wise up summit here ] rangel shared some of his insights about his group ’ s mission as a panelist onstage . on the sidelines , he talked about how life after hate turned what could ’ ve been a horrific incident in buffalo , ny into a moment of reflection and spiritual awakening . “ there was a gentleman contemplating a violent act of extremism against a mosque that he lived in and somehow he found out about our organization…he agreed to meet with us and part of our intervention was seeing if he and the community he was thinking about victimizing were open to meeting together , ” shared rangel . “ both parties came together and were able to reconcile . by the end of that intervention , that man who was a member of the far-right…ended up praying with the imam . and he is now embedded there . he has not converted to any sort of religion , but he ’ s embedded himself as a community member who goes to that mosque routinely now. ” despite its success in encouraging former members of the far right to break away from a hate-filled cycle , life after hate lost all of its government funding once the trump administration took office . when the government announced its grant rewards in june under the auspices of countering violent extremism , life after hate was completely cut off . while the government ’ s motivations for deciding not to reward funds to the organization is unclear , there have been reports that the trump administration has considered discontinuing cve programs dedicated to combating right-wing extremism . while such a move has not been made official , nor the complete gutting of funds for a nonprofit such as life after hate , trump ’ s anti-islamic rhetoric and his condemnation of “ both sides ” after charlottesville plays into the narrative that the administration is not all too concerned with the growing threat of extremism on the right . at the same time the president is quick to go on the offensive in response to purported isis-inspired attacks , he appears more mild-mannered when confronted with a mass shooting perpetrated by a white man , and has said it ’ s inappropriate to discuss gun legislation in the immediate aftermath of a shooting rampage . in the past week , he retweeted an islamophobic video shared by a fringe far-right party in britain , prompting condemnations from many in parliament and muslim advocacy groups in the united states . “ when i was in prison for a number of years , the number one write-up , the number one charge i was always being accused of was ‘ inciting a riot. ’ so there ’ s that word ‘ inciting , ’ right . and i think that we have a national narrative that is inciting and emboldening the types of activities that people are becoming — the wake-up call , right , ” said rangel . “ there are people who i think because how neatly packaged some of this narrative has been , has become palatable for people who might otherwise cringe and say ‘ i ’ m not willing to go that far but i ’ m willing to go this far. ’ ” “ but him crossing that line and stepping all over political correctness , stepping over civil rights advancements , at this point , i think , is kind of speaking and giving a voice to people who have since felt that their voices aren ’ t as powerful as they used to be and aren ’ t quite sure how to share , ” he continued . “ and so their grievances need to be heard through dialogue , our grievances need to be heard through dialogue , but i don ’ t think we have a national voice that is encouraging dialogue . i think it ’ s encouraging sides. ” rangel ’ s fellow co-founder anthony mcaleer considers the alt-right rally in charlottesville a “ wake-up call , ” too . “ i think it ’ s what has always been there became very visible… i think there ’ s many factors to that , ” he told news beat at the wise summit . “ something that we heard during the election is ‘ he said what i think , but i ’ m too afraid to say it. ’ and i think we have to have dialogue and i don ’ t think a huge portion of the population should feel that they ’ re too afraid to say what they ’ re thinking . i think when there is no dialogue then that stuff gets withheld , it ’ s sort of suppressed , and when it gets a chance to release itself , it pukes itself out , it doesn ’ t come out nicely… and i think the key thing is to have dialogue and to listen to each other and not dehumanize each other . i think what ’ s tragically happening in this country is on the left and the right , everybody is dehumanizing everybody… as long as we ’ re dehumanizing anybody for any reason in this country , we can never have peace. ” “ in the absence of that dialogue , the simple solutions offered by demagogues become the only solution , ” added mcaleer . “ if that ’ s all that ’ s being offered to them , that ’ s the only way that they feel they ’ re being heard , they ’ ll go that way…they ’ ll latch onto that. ” in this year alone , the united states has seen an attack on a portland commuter train in which a man killed two good samaritans coming to the aid of a hijab-wearing woman ; the aforementioned terror attack in charlottesville ; and the killing of an african american by a military veteran who took a 200-mile bus trip out of a desire to allegedly target black males . the word “ terrorism ” is defined ambiguously in the media and within government agencies , which is why there ’ s often criticism directed at law enforcement when a terror charge is not attached to white men who carry out seemingly political or social acts of violence . dylann roof , the now-23-year-old who carried out the lethal attack in that historic black church in charleston , for example , was not charged with terror , despite voicing anti-black rhetoric during his massacre . of course , there ’ s also no denying that extremist attacks perpetrated by muslim men are a threat . before the attack in vegas in october , the largest shooting by a single gunman in modern american history was carried out by a muslim man named omar mateen . “ terrorism has been around for two centuries , three centuries , it didn ’ t start in the muslim world , ” explained hasan , the journalist and author . “ clearly it ’ s a problem now in the muslim-majority world . no one is denying there ’ s some pretty vicious violent groups out there . from syria , to pakistan to indonesia , muslim majority countries are grappling with really big problems . but what i would say is to reduce terrorism just to a muslim phenomenon , is not just ahistorical , but it is actually offensive , because what you ’ re doing is you ’ re demonizing one particular community , saying this is a problem of yours , rather than recognizing it is a global problem. ” “ unless you ’ re willing to be consistent , unless you ’ re willing to be have a single standard rather than a double standard , you ’ re not going to be able to beat terrorism , you ’ re not going to inspire people to get together , you ’ re not going to be seen as credible or equitable , ” he added . “ and that ’ s a problem for anyone who wants to safeguard our society. ” originally published at www.usnewsbeat.com on november 30 , 2017 .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_12349,"let me tell you a story about neo-nazis over the summer , i went on my first solo trip through europe : six weeks of hostels and couchsurfing through norway , sweden , finland , the baltics , germany , and denmark . between the united states ’ political situation and general anxiety , i needed to clear my head . in the past , travel did it : non-americans ’ perspective on our country and political climate always seemed to re-center me . the refreshing perspective of non-americans was something i discovered completely by accident during my first trip outside the us . bouncing and shuddering in the back of a tiny airport shuttle , my husband and i strained our ears as an irishman hollered about the 2012 election , obama , and romney over the rattling vehicle ’ s near-deafening din . between the two of us we caught about every third word , but the shuttle driver was the first of many people who continually impressed us with their knowledge of us politics and , well , practically everything about our electoral system . everyone was incredibly well-informed . in fact , to this day i know few american citizens who can explain the us government as well as that irish shuttle driver . when i went on my more recent six-week journey , i wanted to get away from the escalating political media circus in the us . i needed perspective — and maybe a little reassurance that things weren ’ t going to shit everywhere . my first reality check came while couchsurfing in finland . my host asked me if i wanted to go to an anti-nazi picnic . huh . “ anti-nazi ” and “ picnic ” weren ’ t exactly words that i ’ d ever expected to hear combined in my lifetime , but my interest was piqued . it was a quiet sit-in , a counter-protest to neo-nazis who planned to demonstrate outside a mosque ( one that was going to be torn down , no less ) . the peace picnic had two purposes : to show there wasn ’ t room for hate speech in the neighborhood , and out of solidarity for the local muslim community . i agreed to go for two reasons : firstly , i wanted to show my support . secondly , i had a weird sort of curiosity—what did finnish neo-nazis look like , exactly ? did they wear uniforms ? did they goose-step ? were they a real-life nazi parody ? the answer surprised me . they looked like , well… everyday men and women , standing outside a grocery store with banners . and that ’ s not to normalize the nazis in any way , but the anarchists standing in between the two groups and trying to start a fight looked far more intimidating , with their black clothing and thinly-veiled threats . but the neo-nazis weren ’ t wearing swastikas , nor were they yelling about jews . when i asked my host what they were saying , she said that it roughly translated to : “ keep finland for finland ” . their banners and slogans were all about nationalism : “ protecting ” finland from outsiders who were encroaching on their country ’ s culture and values . more than anything , they were eager to appeal to the fears of people who recoil from the unknown , the different , the “ other ” , the outside : people who might alter finnish culture , even though culture is a fluid and ever-changing thing . their “ everyday men and women ” look might fool you on the surface , but these people were angry and dangerous . they didn ’ t have obvious markers of neo-naziism because they didn ’ t want passers-by associating their appeals to nationalism , immigration fears , and islamophobia with nazi extremism . if a shopper coming out of the grocery store saw a swastika , they ’ d be immediately repulsed and unwilling to listen . but if they came out of the store and thought those people with finnish flags and slogans about preserving finnish culture had some interesting ideas , they might be swayed . and the group even has a nationalist , patriotic-sounding name : suomi ensin , or “ finland first ” . it sounds harmless enough on the surface , doesn ’ t it — that you ’ ll put your country first ? as a helsinki resident , my couchsurfing host knew how dangerous the group could be . when she went over to look at them , she hid her face with a bandanna . i wasn ’ t a local : i didn ’ t have anything to worry about — they couldn ’ t follow me home or figure out where i lived . however , she knew what they were capable of : they ’ d been sending death threats to her neighbor , who organized the peaceful picnic sit-in ; they were known to stalk or send death and rape threats to women who dared oppose them ; and , while they might demonstrate prettily in front of the police , they weren ’ t opposed to violence , defacement , and destruction . later that evening , my friend and i walked past the mosque only to discover that a swastika had been spray painted on a back wall and a front window had been smashed . after the official protest , the neo-nazis had snuck back to vandalize the mosque . and , just a few weeks after the picnic , a finnish man who was assaulted by neo-nazis died , resulting in thousands turning out to protest against racism . in his article on the rise of the neo-nazi alt-right in the us , shaun king writes , “ one does not have to do a nazi salute in public to be a neo-nazi , ” and he ’ s completely correct . you don ’ t have to wear the uniform , do the salute , shout “ sieg-heil ” , or wear swastikas to be a neo-nazi . i know this now because i ’ ve seen them— not just once or twice , but again and again , throughout my travels in europe . publicly , neo-nazis seemingly preferred to fly under the radar with nationalist rhetoric appealing to fears about cultural change , immigrants , refugees , and terrorism . if you go to their websites or forums , you might find the swastikas . but in public , when they ’ re trying to recruit you ? not so much . my journey throughout europe continued . in germany , i talked at length with the woman who ran my hostel . germany has set an example for the rest of europe by accepting and integrating over 1 million refugees in 2015 alone . the hostel manager was one of many sympathetic germans who provided water to refugees as they waited in soaring summer temperatures outside aid offices in berlin . however , the refugee crisis has led to increased fear in germany — and throughout europe —along with the rise of the anti-immigrant right . she expressed her fears about the “ alternative for germany ” party , which has its own nationalist , neo-nazi tendencies . swastikas are illegal in germany , so they daren ’ t use that symbolism , at least not openly . nonetheless , that party recently won a record 14.2 % of the vote in the berlin parliament . as written in the new statesman in march 2016 : nationalism . patriotism . islamophobia . anti-immigration . anti-refugees . anti-difference . anti-change . the rallying cry of the neo-nazis outside the grocery store was being echoed by “ alternative for germany ” . on the same trip , i wandered through downtown copenhagen and stumbled across a mob of people—a protest and a counter-protest , with the usual anarchists in the middle . on one side , an anti-immigrant group shouted nationalist and patriotic slogans , waving danish flags . on the other side , a group wearing neon green alien masks chanted in favor of open borders and acceptance . it seemed this battle was being fought everywhere , whether i sought it out or not . returning home , i wasn ’ t as at ease as i ’ d hoped . should i feel better ? should i feel worse ? i ’ d sought reassurance , but instead i discovered that everywhere had problems : neo-nazis , nationalists , and the anti-immigration far-right cracking down on anyone they perceived to be different and , therefore , dangerous . in the four years since my first international trip , so much about europe had changed . now , sitting in a cafe in israel—one of the countries where i am , perhaps , least-likely to encounter neo-nazis—i continue to read about the disturbing appointment of steve bannon ; the public appearance of swastikas , accompanied by trump ’ s name ; the 31 % increase in hate crime in new york ; and the increasingly-empowered alt-right , neo-nazis by any other name : i ’ ve seen it in finland . i ’ ve seen it in germany . i ’ ve seen it in denmark . and now , i ’ m seeing it in the united states . it ’ s not new — the alt-right has been lurking in the internet ’ s dark margins for the last half decade — but the difference is that they ’ ve now been given a voice , a platform , an advocate , and legitimacy . when cnn is genuinely treating questions like , “ are jews people ? ” as if they are as neutral and unobjectionable as “ will it rain tomorrow ? ” , we have a fucking problem . trump may go on 60 minutes and put on a good show of being “ saddened ” and saying “ stop it ” — he may claim he intends to be a president for everyone — but actions speak louder than words : don ’ t doubt for a moment that he doesn ’ t know exactly what he ’ s doing or whom he ’ s empowering with each and every one of these appointments . from putting white supremacist anti-semites like steven bannon in immensely powerful government positions to making racists like jeffrey sessions ( once deemed too racist to be a judge ) the attorney general , the list keeps growing and it ’ s far from accidental . trump isn ’ t going to stop it . his followers aren ’ t going to stop it . the alt-right/alt-reich neo-nazis aren ’ t going to stop it . the violence , hatred , and destruction isn ’ t going to stop unless we do something to stop it . so , my question to you is : how do we ? kimberly is a writer and photographer . she ’ s currently extremely worried , and it ’ s not because she has an anxiety disorder . the rest of the time you ’ ll find her traveling or eating . leave a tip ❤ | fb | instagram | twitter | plethora-etc.com more than anything , the neo-nazis were eager to appeal to the fears of people who recoil from the unknown .

[ … ] [ the party has shifted ] concentrating less on the euro and more on issues such as migration , islam and closer ties with russia . this led a bitter lucke to claim in july 2015 that the afd was turning into a “ pegida party ” , a reference to germany ’ s far-right movement of “ patriotic europeans against the islamisation of the west ” , a label he had refuted as party leader . as [ alt-right leader richard spencer ] finished , several audience members had their arms outstretched in a nazi salute . when mr. spencer , or perhaps another person standing near him at the front of the room — it was not clear who — shouted , “ heil the people ! heil victory , ” the room shouted it back . trump may claim he intends to be a president for everyone , but actions speak louder than words : don ’ t doubt for a moment that he doesn ’ t know exactly who he ’ s empowering .

medium_antiracist_40674,"reportback : jason kessler returns to uva law library for the second time in a week uva has issued a no trespass warning to ban jason kessler from university property . congratulations to student and faculty organizers for moving the university into action . the next step for the university to meet student demands is to issue similar no trespass warnings against the other white supremacists at the august 11 torch rally . uva law students and supporting community members rapidly mobilized to confront a white supremacist in the uva law library again this wednesday , april 25 . approximately 40 people showed up to respond to the specific threat of violence that this particular white supremacist poses on grounds to uva students . members of the community have been putting everything on the line to keep this community safe , forced to to because the university continues to do nothing . uva has done nothing since kessler ’ s appearance last wednesday , and uva has done nothing in the 259 days since august 11 ’ s violent nazi torch rally on grounds . prior to kessler ’ s reappearance at the law library , the university police department ( upd ) issued this new trespassing policy , and item # 4 under its policy statement section explicitly gives the upd authority to issue a trespass warning to : a person who has engaged in… conduct that threatens the health , safety , or property of a member of the university or its medical center community , a patient or visitor at the medical center or other persons on university or medical center property . kessler ’ s august 11 , 2017 torch rally on grounds is well-documented : multiple students and community members were recorded being beaten by rally participants that night . kessler is an undeniable offender according to wednesday ’ s newly-issued trespass policy and should have been banned from campus on sight . solidarity cville posted an urgent call-to-action on twitter once we were notified of kessler ’ s arrival at the library . students and community members responded immediately . solidarity cville received this photo ( above ) shortly after the call-to-action was issued . uva police were now blocking the entryway to a private office provided to kessler , seemingly so he could conduct legal research without being reminded of the extensive damage he does to this community . in the meantime , a library staff member was asked to leave his own workplace . shortly after kessler was ensconced within the private office , community member eric martin attempted to sit with kessler to read his own book ( “ the rise and fall of apartheid ” ) . but uva authorities ordered eric to leave . and when eric attempted to assert his right to the same sanctuary that kessler enjoyed , he was arrested for trespassing . on re-reading the upd ’ s new trespass policy — again , issued earlier that same day — it is not clear how eric was violating any part of the policy . kessler , however , remained undisturbed by authorities in the library until he was ready to leave of his own accord . once kessler finished his readings , he was swiftly escorted out through an emergency exit by the kkkops who had earlier been guarding the door to his private study . as they say : throughout this incident , community members called and sent email messages to multiple university administrators to demand kessler ’ s immediate removal . those calls went unheeded . in the aftermath , the university law school announced a ban of all non-law students for the next two weeks , effective immediately . but our community knows what ’ s really up : uva has a long journey of truth and reconciliation ahead . immediately , students and community members are calling for uva to issue a no trespass order against jason kessler and all the organizers of and participants in the august 11 torch march on uva . here are two ways to support the call for a no trespass order : a coalition of uva student groups will host a rally outside the uva rotunda during the board of visitors meeting today to demand that uva issue a no trespassing order against jason kessler and all other white supremacists who participated in the august 11th torch rally . and share it with all concerned uva students , staff , alum , and other community members .",medium_antiracist

 why ? history is perception .  
 how can that so easily be effaced ? perception relies on memory .  
 why is it that memory is not permanent ? because living beings do nothing but change , ceaselessly . within one life we forget . within one life we decide that what we thought meant strength is now weakness , fear is now pity , loyalty was not abuse .  
 where in one life do we do this ? in a moment .  
 and what are moments the smallest unit of ? time . 

 i leave it to you to judge for yourself whether there is more history or more time . and i leave it to you to judge whether history or time is stronger , when i have shown that the smallest unit of time can , all by itself , change the building blocks of history .

reddit_antiracist_82967,"i appreciate the long response , thanks for taking the time . the thing i agree with is exactly what you typed above , with the exception of "" do n't you think the rest of the piece makes it clear that she thinks no such thing ? "" there is a distinction between criticizing someone ’s argument for a point and disagreeing with that point . i absolutely agree that white privilege permeates society and that in the day to day actions it is expressed in subtle ways . i 'll even go so far as to agree that altucher was being a dick and a half and that his assertions about how to get things in life just reek of "" well - off white guy "" who is blind to the fact that being that is what makes a lot of these things possible . the title of his article is also pretty nauseating . 

 in response to your question , she says : “ maybe nobody noticed because you happened to look a lot like the other bank of america employees ? ” and “ if i complain to your manager , you know your manager is going to listen to me . just look at me , and look at you . ” i do n’t think she actively believes black people ca n’t run banks , but these two statements do suggest that in her mind she automatically ascribes races to people in certain positions , which is partially what the article is speaking out against . and just because the article is against something racial does n’t preclude the author from unintentionally making racist statements . 
 from here i ’ll go into specifics about the article , it ’ll be long but i do n’t really see another way to fully explain myself . 

 the first 2 incidents she describes involve white dudes in finance assuming that because they 're wealthy and in their careers have some cred / power they deserve special treatment . i agree that there are some racial subtleties to this entitlement , and the fact that "" successful wall st guy "" conjures up an image of a white man to the author is entirely different race conversation . that considered , i think she completely overplays the racial aspect of these stories . 

 i ’m starting to think the cutting in line story was a means of getting in a twitter plug , as i believe that if someone feels entitled to skip a line the racial makeup of the line is probably irrelevant .    after reading his article i think altucher is clearly oblivious to the fact that being who he was made what he did possible , and writing an article about how easy it is to make life happen your way while ignoring that is douchey and condescending . aside from that , however , i think the amount of racial overtones dziura ascribes to his actions is a little over the top ( though i 'm not saying they are n't there to a degree ) . 

 the 3 articles she links to and the references she makes to them i actually really liked and i thought she ’d keep going in this vein , but then she continues on about how it ’s not nice to take things that are n’t yours ( she has a soft spot for true fashion show attendees apparently ) . acknowledging that when you take something it comes from somewhere else is a good thing , but again i do n’t see the overtly racial side of this either . the article then takes a turn for the hypothetical and though the workplace scenarios she lists point out the shittiness of entitlement i do n’t see it as being synonymous with white privilege here . the train goes off the rails for me when she goes on for a few paragraphs about how possibly cutting one person in line because the salesperson calls you up even though someone else was technically waiting longer makes you an asshole and , as the title / tone of the article suggests , flexing your white privilege muscles . this is probably about where the word “ asshole ” came to mind . 

 reading this article reminded me a lot of watching a michael moore documentary ; in general i completely agree with his stance , but the actual mechanics he uses to get there tends to enrage me . or , to paraphrase the dude , she ’s not wrong , she ’s just an asshole . i think she was stretching and splitting hairs in a lot of places and that cheapens the message . the article has some great points about white privilege with specific examples of how it adversely affects non - whites . she says some important things about entitlement , in both society and the workplace . she points out ways in which people on the daily assert themselves to the disadvantage of others . hats off to her . but in an article called “ when life hacking is really white privilege ” i do n’t think it ’s fair to put all of these in the same basket with the same label . i ’m sure an astute redditor can make the argument that they are one in the same , but in my opinion this was a stretch at best and frankly i think she was going for a bit of sensationalization with the title and then loosely weaved things together to make it fit . 

 this happens with a lot of things , but in reference to this article specifically , it bothers me that people often take every word of an article exposing racism to be gold , and that anyone who disagrees with any aspect of the anti - racist viewpoint is branded with the scarlet r. i do n’t think that absolutely everything everyone ever has or ever will say about racism , both pro and anti , is true , and to blindly believe one or the other is ignorant to some degree . again , there is a distinction between criticizing someone ’s argument for a point and disagreeing with that point , and i think blurring the two really inhibits open and honest dialog about race . 

 * * tl;dr i agree with the commenter on almost everything , i just think dziura is soapboxing , and i do n’t think it ’s necessarily racist to criticize an anti - racist article * *

medium_antiracist_47011,"legal discrimination against native americans the early european explorers and settlers described the native americans as innocent , ingenious , friendly , and naked . in a sense , the native americans were seen as childish — one of the early stereotypes about them . as more european settlers arrived , english concepts of property — land transfer , titles , deeds — were inserted into the relations between the settlers and the natives . it is not surprising to find that much of the discrimination against native americans was tied very closely to the legalistic legitimation of land grabs by european settlers . the bulk of this discrimination is found in legal documents , especially treaties , that defined the nature of native americans ’ presence and residence on their own land . the taking of native american land by whites was philosophically legitimized by the principle of manifest destiny , the belief of european americans that “ through divine ordination and the natural superiority of the white race , they had a right ( and indeed an obligation ) to seize and occupy all of north america.… during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , the philosophy of manifest destiny was accompanied by several pieces of legislation that accomplished under… law that which would not have been legally justifiable through military force ” . central pieces of legislation that defined the u.s. government ’ s relationship with native americans include the following : indian removal act ( 1830 ) . andrew jackson used this act to force the mass relocation of the creek , cherokee , choctaw , seminole , and other indian nations during the 1830s . the intent was to open up the territory east of the mississippi for settlement by white americans and their african slaves . major crimes act ( 1885 ) . this act allowed the united states to extend its jurisdiction into native american territories . since the treaty defined the sovereignty of native american territories , this act nullified the treaty ’ s purpose , which had permitted native americans to exercise their own jurisdiction within their own territories . general allotment act ( 1887 ) . also known as the “ dawes act , ” this act was designed to break up the collective ownership of indian lands by requiring indians to identify themselves by means of a “ blood quantum ” code . under the act , “ full-blood indians ” received the deeds to land parcels over which the u.s. government exercised control for twenty-five years , and “ mixed-blood indians ” received “ patents in fee simple ” — basically land rental agreements — and were forced to accept u.s. citizenship . as a result of the act ’ s implementation , the united states acquired over 100 million acres of native american land between 1887 and 1934 . indian citizenship act ( 1924 ) . this act conferred u.s. citizenship on all native americans born within the territorial limits of the united states . the act ’ s purpose was to curtail the demand for indigenous identity among native americans . to protest , the hopi and onondaga refuse to acknowledge the act by issuing their own tribal passports . indian claims commission act ( 1946 ) . there is some speculation that this act originated , in part , as a response to the role the united states played at the nuremberg trials . the act was designed to provide legal recourse to those native americans who felt that their land was unjustly taken away from them . the act established the claims commission , responsible for hearing cases brought forward by native americans . the commission , however , was not empowered to return the land to any native american ; rather , it was required to assign a monetary value to the land in question — “ at the time it was taken. ” as a result , awards given out by the commission tended to be very small . in general , the act gave the united states the tool to legitimize its claim to native american lands . relocation act ( 1956 ) . this act created job training centers in urban areas for native americans . the purpose of the act was to force native americans off the reservation by offering job training opportunities only in urban areas . native americans participating in the job training programs were required to sign formal agreements that they would not return to their reservations . alaska native claims settlement act ( 1971 ) . the act removed the sovereign status of the indian nations in alaska by incorporating them into the united states . approximately 44 million acres of native american lands were turned into u.s. assets . the importance of this act is that the incorporation of native american lands included the oil beneath and the timber on top . treaties were the first step in the colonization of native americans . most of the legal concepts — such as land deeds and land tenure — were foreign to natives , but they accepted treaties as a “ good-faith ” attempt at coexistence with the whites . native americans perceived treaties as a recognition of their sovereignty as indian nations and assumed that they were on an equal legal footing with the united states . the second step in the colonization of native americans was congressional legislation , such as the acts reviewed above , which became a tool for displacing native americans from their lands . congress ’ s efforts to alter the original treaties with native american nations were motivated by the white settlers ’ demands for yet more land . without their land , native americans lost their sovereign status and became a fully colonized population . all these manipulations of the law increasingly undermined the promises of the 1787 northwest ordinance : such laws , as it turns out , were used as a tool for doing great wrong . if you ’ re looking for content or copy that sells and positions you as an expert in your field , i can help . subscribing to my feed is a great way to continue reading my content .",medium_antiracist

 i completely see why the "" mental construction occurred , "" it is a trending topic . 

 while i understand that there is not one expert in any field , it is not just simply my opinion . opinion in academia , especially in the humanities and social sciences , is only as insightful as the thought and time put into it . and while i can not speak for everyone , you asked why my opinions had any weight to them and i answered your question . just like someone who finished medical school knows more then an eleventh grader , my personal experiences and education do add to the conversation . otherwise , by your standards , all education and life experiences are valueless . 

 that largely was my goal , i used the term trans - racial because it resonates with the redeeming elements of queer theory that are used to speak to the complexity of gender identity . beyond the semantics of whether or not "" trans - racial "" is a good term , my focus is on the content of the actual video . i do not wish to change language ( or that is not my main goal ) , but instead wish to voice the significance of what i mean by a trans - racial identity . 

 while my last point also answered your closing arguments , i can add : 1 ) as i said before , trans - racial cites the majority of queer literature that aims to establish the ambiguity and performativity of gender identity . here , i am making reference to this same literature to , then ,   expand the discussion to include race . 2 ) if people use the term "" mix raced "" but still identify with the major point of my video , that 's fine , like i said , this is an issue of semantics . however - 4 ) while "" trans "" refers to a political element ( transgressing boundaries ) , the term "" mixed "" actually seems to cite the larger north american ideologies of "" the melting pot , "" and "" multiculturalism , "" thus re - establishing the cultural and historical heritage of specific ethnicities ( while this is appropriate for some people , it is not for all ) . in contrast to this , another objective i had in sharing my story was to illustrate that cultural heritage and historical narratives are n't biological ( or automatic ) . hence , much like the work of bernardine evaristo , for example , ( a great example being blonde roots ) , the prefix "" trans "" may allow for a bluring of fixed histories and imagined communities . whereas the term "" mixed "" may suggest a mixing of identities ( wherein , the subject still has a connection to these assumed "" roots ) . 

 therefore , "" mixed racial "" and "" trans - racial "" can be thought of as two different things .

 i do n't say any of this to be malicious or spiteful , only to tell you that you are not only wasting your time trying to discuss these issues but also causing yourself unnecessary distress .   i do n't know your situation , but at this point in history , the country has gone back to a very dark place and is likely to remain there for at least a generation if not longer .   the americans you thought were decent , open - minded , etc . , have essentially revealed through their passivity in the face of what 's transpired that the whole thing was a charade .   it 's not pleasant to hear , but i think it would be far more productive for you to limit contact with your compatriots at this point , begin learning a second language and look into a new place to call home rather than trying to convince them that racism is a massive problem here .   they know it at some level , but even if they are n't overtly racist themselves , most of them still harbor prejudices and simply do n't care enough to do anything about it .   if you continue trying to get them to actually display some humanity or even an indication of rational thought , you might as well just bang your head repeatedly into a wall .   the result will largely be the same . 

 there is absolutely nothing wrong with you .   you 're one of the few sane ones in the mental asylum .   the overwhelming majority of the people in the us simply are n't very bright and are considered as little more than dangerous yokels on the world stage .   if you value your sanity , you will limit contact with them and seek out more enlightened company .   good luck and godspeed .",reddit_antiracist

 ... but white people do n’t like to engage , as diangelo has often gleaned in   her capacity as a diversity consultant for companies and other   organizations . whenever they are told that their race affords them   systemic advantages , or that they ca n’t help being racist or benefiting   from racism , or that their behavior is racially “ problematic , ” white   people respond with anger , denial , guilt or tears — with white   fragility . “ their responses are so predictable i sometimes feel as   though we are all reciting lines from a shared script , ” she writes . "" 

  she describes responses from people which get played out constantly .

reddit_antiracist_64884,"“ our study reveals that black patients have worse outcomes largely because they tend to go to worse - performing hospitals , ” 

 why would this be the case ?   when people typically speak of medical racism , it 's usually more of a personal issue of doctors and medical staff not attending to black patients the same way that they would patients of other races .   maybe there is a systematic element to the lower quality of health care black people receive in this country . maybe the inequality can be attributed to the funding and staffing of hospitals that serve black communities . this is especially so within areas that have large black populations . i also know that black people that live in rural areas of the south have less access to healthcare .   i 'm sure that patients of these lower quality hospitals pay the same amount in medical bills as patients in higher - quality hospitals . 



 i have family in the places mentioned in this article and i can assure you that everything is 100 % correct .   people have to drive 30 + miles from some localities to get treatment . if they want care from a charity hospital , you can more than double that distance . these places also lack employment opportunities so it 's hard to get out . it 's basically a rural ghetto . not to mention the fact that this is also the same region where the the tuskegee syphilis study

medium_antiracist_20896,"how whiteness works : why white murderers get to have a bad day and victims of color are villainized taharee a. jackson , ph.d. drtaharee consulting march 24 , 2021 i am asian , black , and a woman . and i am in exhausted . as a diversity consultant , a year ago i began addressing anti-asian american and pacific islander ( aapi ) racism during a pandemic that teased out centuries of “ yellow ” hate . as a black woman , i then started speaking time and time again about the virulent ( videorecorded ) spate of anti-black racism , police brutality , murder by law enforcement , and the mistreatment of african americans for the remainder of the 2020 . now we are a fresh three months into 2021 and here i am , looping right back to anti-asian violence and race-based murder . anti-asian racism never went away , but we like to humor ourselves and think that it never existed . i am reaching my limit , and my racial battle fatigue is at its zenith , but i am not going to murder 8 innocent white men who tickle my proclivity for outrage over racism . i am an asian woman , but you don ’ t have to be asian to be outraged by the brutal killing of 8 innocent women — 6 of whom were asian — at the hands of a white man with a gun who , as former cherokee county , georgia spokesperson captain jay baker explained , “ had a really bad day. ” in fact , you should feel outraged not only by the murders themselves , but the empathy of captain baker and the subsequent humanization of a “ faithful ” man with a sex addiction . all of that is fair fodder for ire . a solution seeker , i am not here to stoke the fire of ire — neither yours nor mine . after all , anger is often referred to as a secondary emotion and always underpinned by other emotions such as pain , frustration , hurt , and sadness . i am experiencing all of those . as the daughter of an asian woman who bears absolute resemblance to the innocent souls taken in atlanta , and as the target of everyday anti-asian and anti-black racism , i am hurt . after more than a year of incident after incident , having to juxtapose the treatment of antiracism protestors of color versus white insurrectionists at the united states capitol , and now witnessing the sympathetic treatment of , and perverse excuse-making for white male murderers versus the veritable victims of racial violence , i am ready to move forward . to move productively through my pain . in previous pieces i have written about hypothetical racism , or the trauma we feel when we as people of color ( poc ) , or even critically conscious white people , have to witness gross disparities in the curated narrative , consequence , and conviction of perpetrators based on race . here i will undergird that phenomenon by discussing the true heart of the matter — how whiteness works , and what helps to explain the soft treatment of white murderers and the villainization of victims of color . you can not change that which you do not understand , and you will not fix that which you refuse to name . for anyone who feels the sting of the summer of george floyd , the unspeakable disgust of breonna taylor ’ s slaying in her sleep , the heartache of grieving these atlanta-based women whose only crime is their asianness and their femaleness , and the outrage of witnessing yet another white male get away with murder , this is for you . this is for all of us who are tired of viewing the same film over and over with the same predictable ending . maya angelou implores us to learn more because when you know better you do better . america , please take copious notes on the features and functionality of whiteness because it undergirds everything we do here . from the outrageous mass murders in atlanta and now colorado…to the villainization of botham jean , who was murdered in his own apartment by a white police officer while minding his own business…to the everyday disparities we witness wherever we live and breathe…white racial dominance must be stopped . or at least interrupted . the murderous behavior of unchecked , angry white males must be brought to justice . and the treatment of asian women and asian americans in every part of this country must be upgraded to the same levels of dignity and respect we afford to white shooters instinctively , inevitably , and with no issue whatsoever . do better , america . here ’ s how . here ’ s how whiteness works . i have spent the majority of my double-decade career as a diversity consultant explaining implicit bias , cultural racism , and the deeply-rooted , largely subconscious rationales we use to explain human behavior based on race . implicit bias is strong . sociocultural racism , which teaches us what to believe about various groups over time , is downright pernicious . when we first see a person , we make instant assessments of their character , intentions , and aptitude based almost exclusively on what we have learned about their group . when many see an african american man , they become tense , raise their awareness , guard their purses , move farther away in the elevator , clutch their children , and cross the street . why ? they are associating black skin and blackness with danger , a threat , criminal intent , and harm . when we see asian american women , many will instantly conjure images of an exotic , subservient , recently-immigrated , non-english accent-speaking siren whose sole purpose is to please you sexually . many may assume that if her husband is an american military veteran , their love is in part rooted in sexual exploits that took place in some lascivious red light district in a faraway asian city . the stereotypes about hypersexualized , morally bereft , “ easy ” asian women allows us to dehumanize them to the point that we might learn about the atlanta shooter ’ s rampage and say , “ but what do they actually do at that spa ? is it really a “ spa , ” or might it be a den of prostitution ? ” in other words , were these primarily asian women in some way guilty , or dare i say “ responsible ” for their own deaths ? were they really just masseuses or were they up to no good ? in the same way that we can watch a police officer quite literally murder george floyd in the street and face questions like , “ but what happened before the video started rolling ? ” one can see how the assumption of moral bereftness , promiscuity , and possible prostitution might lead one to ask , “ but what role did these asian women play in their own demise ? ” “ were they even here legally ? i hear they smuggle asian women here all the time for sex work… ” in the same way that we can learn of a jogging ahmaud arbery ’ s murder in broad daylight and hear questions like , “ but was he out jogging in his own area or was he a possible… suspicious…guilty-of-something outsider ? ” we can understand how , when the veritable victims of crimes are black , indigenous , people of color ( bipoc ) , we have no problem whatsoever imagining what they may have done to deserve their fate . not so for whiteness . whiteness equals the benefit of the doubt and the assumption of benevolence . mass murderers and violent shootings are disproportionately carried out by white men . each time they occur , we actually get to see how the legal proceedings play out because we tend to arrest these violent murderers rather than killing them instantly . ( see , for example , white supremacist and “ wayward boy ” dylann roof , “ don ’ t kill our son ” aurora shooter james holmes , and eventually , n-word shouting travis and gregory mcmichael . ) once we have them safely in custody , we begin to curate careful narratives about their upbringing and what may have gone awry for them . we begin with the assumption of a well-meaning white man who was driven to violence , and is otherwise a peace-loving , benevolent human being . we incite national dialogue about mental health , bullying , and the gross neglect of white male emotional fragility . we gather testimony from their white neighbors about their character , and how he was a quiet neighbor who never bothered a soul , and how outrageous and shocking it is that he would do such a thing . he would never behave in a manner so unbecoming a white man . this narrative is followed sequentially by a trial , oftentimes during which the vast majority of judges , attorneys , jurors , and law enforcement offers are also white . and in disproportionately many cases , white men as well . the same “ white male-gone-astray who had a bad day ” sympathy we culled from captain jay baker is inevitably invoked , and this is how we end up with lighter sentences for white murderers , almost no criminal convictions for murderous white police officers , and what i predict will be a lighter consequence for the most recent atlanta shooter based on the extraordinary burden of evidence currently required to prosecute hate crimes . the same reasons that i , as a highly educated , christian woman , am almost always followed in stores as a suspicious , pre-guilty shoplifter , guide our decisions to pre-criminalize victims of racial violence in ways that point to their own doing . their own fault . black people and people of color are the only people who are blamed for their own deaths . the same reasons that i , as a monogamous , faithful partner , unmarried , childless woman get summoned at a casino by a gambler who says , “ hey honey , can you bring me a drink ? where do you stay ? i ’ ve never had asian before , ” guide our decisions to implicate these asian women in their own demise . they had to have done something wrong . perhaps they were a temptation for the shooter ? what is terribly wrong here is that no matter who i am or what i do as an asian and black woman , i will never be presumed as innocent as a guilty-as-sin white man . that ’ s how implicit bias works . that is how stereotyping works . that is how racial profiling works . most importantly , that is how whiteness works . 2 . whiteness equals rightness , authority , and credibility . color equals inferiority and out-of-placeness . as a woman of color , my presence is always a little “ suspicious. ” not just in my shopping habits , but in my right to exist in spaces without question . if i am in charge , i seem out of place . when most people ask for a manager , or the leader , or “ the person in charge in this room ” ( i was a professor for 17 years and routinely ignored as such ) , they are not expecting to see me . the glaring lack of diversity in leadership primes them not to expect me , and race and gender-based low expectations leave them surprised by me . in other words , they don ’ t see me or my credentials coming . if i were a white man , every space would belong to me . if i were white , it would be understood that i worked hard , pulled myself up by my bootstraps , and achieved everything i accomplished by way of merit . an infuriating feature of whiteness is that we assume that whoever is in charge , on top , in control , and at the helm is and should be white , and that they got there fairly . this is why 45 of 46 presidents have been white men . this is why most members of congress are white men . most ceos are white men . most university presidents are white men . and if they are anything else , we cry foul and are instantly suspicious of “ how they got the position. ” the most empowered leaders in this country are white , and that is their assumed , rightful place . me on the other hand ? no . i have traveled a long and windy path to become the founder and tonesetter-in-chief of my own diversity consultancy . i have sat next to a disproportionate number of white people at harvard ; when i was earning my ph.d. ; and even now as i work with the world ’ s best and brightest scientists . at every turn , whether i was in college , or in my doctoral program , or leading a training for senior officers in the military , someone inevitably asked if i was truly supposed to be there . did you get into harvard by way of affirmative action ? no . and even if they made a mistake , no one did my homework and earned these magna cum laude double degrees . did you get the doctoral fellowship because you ’ re the diversity candidate ? no . and even if they made a mistake , no one earned my 4.0 gpa while holding multiple full-time jobs . are you speaking to all the highest-ranked military officers because you are the daughter of a black army sergeant and a bangkok whore ? no . my parents loved one another deeply and i am the proud product of their 30-year union . but even if they made a mistake , i have the most innovative ideas about how to move the military forward given my expertise in white antiracism and combating racial extremism in the ranks . how has centuries of allowing white men and their “ matching ” white partners to lead your antiracism efforts worked out for you thus far ? what demoralizes asian and black women like me every day is the assumption of authority , credibility , and belonging — or always being in the right place , having rightfully gotten there — that we so easily afford to white men who may not be exceptional or even qualified . in fact , they may even be mediocre . i will no longer refer to “ diversity ” hires . rather , i will refer to them as “ homogeneity ” hires . they were not hired because they were exceptional , but because they were white and maintained the organization ’ s comfortable , homogeneous , mostly white workforce . i will no longer refer to “ diversity ” interns . rather , i will refer to them as “ status quo ” interns . they were not the most qualified , forward-thinking , or promising innovators , but they reminded you of you , and they did not disrupt your comfortable white workplace status quo . you can mentor and mold them into the same white leaders you are , and you need not change a single thing about your intentional succession planning to keep reproducing the same organization you have right now . whiteness works by positioning me as somehow in the wrong position , inferior , non-credible , an outsider , and perpetually out of place while positioning whiteness and white people as natural leaders , meritorious achievers , and those who “ truly ” belong . that i can earn two degrees from harvard and a ph.d. and still be questioned about my acceptance to an institution , my position in a workplace , and my intellectual prowess in white male-dominated spaces is not the result of my lack of effort or erudition . that is the result of my lack of whiteness . that is how whiteness works . 3 . whiteness equals normativity and invisibility . color equals “ otherness ” and un-americanness . a key feature of whiteness , which toni morrison gorgeously explicates in playing in the dark : whiteness in the literary imagination , is the notion that to be white is normal , invisible , and standard . the american story is one of whiteness and white people , carefully dotted by people of color just to keep the exclusion police at bay . whiteness is so heavily normalized in literature , morrison explains , that unless the characters are anything but white , authors simply do not name their race . the assumption is that every character is white unless explicitly stated , and that can easily lead one to believe that people of color either do not exist , or that they are simply unimportant . we are learning how whiteness works based on the outrage caused by castings of characters who are not white . from harry potter and the cursed child stage play , where the role of hermione granger was cast as a black woman , we learned that even the fictitious literary imagination will not tolerate aberrations in an assumed all-white cast of ( fictitious ! ) characters . we learn from films such as the great wall , rooted in china but starring matt damon , and ghost in the shell , based on japanese manga characters but starring scarlett johansson , are completely acceptable , whereas the hiring of a black santa claus at a mall is beyond disgust . when ronald takaki penned a different mirror : a history of multicultural america , his epic contribution to american history was his inclusion of every manner of human being — proudly among them asian americans — who literally built , supported , and even saved this country at multiple turns . to refocus immigration stories not just from ellis island , but angel island in strangers from a different shore : a history of asian americans , was nothing short of a vital turn in the american dialogue regarding who belongs , who built this great nation , and who is truly american . mia tuan challenged us over two decades ago to consider what it means to be a “ forever foreigner , ” or someone to whom you can always yell , “ go home ! ” or “ go back to wherever you came from ! ” as asian americans , african americans , and all other hyphenated americans , we are far enough removed from whiteness that we can never simply be “ american ” unless we are strictly referring to our nationality . in other words , we are perpetual foreigners , or someone considered outside the realm of true americans , outside the purview of what it truly means to “ be from this country , ” and forever immigrants . we are merely guests in a country that is quick to remind us that we are not from here , we don ’ t belong here , and we should leave here lest we wear out our welcome with the audacity of equality . as an asian and black woman , with a phenotype that immediately indicates that i am both , each time i show my face to someone i don ’ t know , the inevitable question is , “ where are you from ? ” and because i am visually multiracial , an equally popular question is , more crudely , “ what are you ? ” how being a woman of color works is that as long as i do not look white , someone is always going to approach me and essentially demand that i disclose just how not american i am . where is your mother from ? where is your father from ? where are their parents from ? where are you from originally ? where are your ancestors from ? and my favorite… “ what are your fractions ? how much of each thing are you ? ” how whiteness works is that you can simply answer the question , “ what are you ? ” with white . or american . or my favorite… i ’ m a blue-blooded american . the truth of the matter is that even if someone asks you what you are ( which , they likely won ’ t ) , no one is ever going to ask you what kind of white you are . or at least not at the same rate as they ask me what kind of person of color i am . and the best part ? as a white person — as a white american — someone actually could ask you what kind of white you are , and you are free not to know . during my years as a professor , many students would simply say , “ i ’ m just a mutt ! some irish…maybe german…i don ’ t know ! i ’ m just american ! ” we don ’ t get to stay that . we don ’ t get to stop at “ american ” without stopping at a hyphen first . whiteness has a history of being the normal , invisible standard . whiteness has the luxury of being equated to americanness . a white person actually can say they are american with no further questions asked . no additional qualifiers , no interrogation , and no further demands for your ethnic breakdown . when you can represent yourself fully and completely based solely on your historically amalgamated whiteness , you are not an “ other. ” you are not a forever foreigner or perpetual immigrant because this is your home and you belong here . you are american . you are the standard . you are so omnipresent that the whiteness of everyone is assumed until there is a phenotypical reason to ask about “ heritage ” and ethnicity . that is what it means to be white and american . to be white , for so many , automatically means to be american . that is how whiteness works . 4 . whiteness equals individuality . color equals representation . my hometown is not too far from virginia tech . when the gruesome campus shootings occurred in 2007 at the hands of a south korean student , there was an immediate response from the asian american community . they quickly reassured the public that this person was aberrant , not like the rest of us asians , and most certainly didn ’ t typify our good asian intentions in this country . why is it that when a person of color , a person who happens to be muslim , or anyone other than a white person commits a crime , it is incumbent upon an entire group of people to : 1 ) apologize on behalf of all people who look like that , 2 ) reassure the public that we are not all dangerous and do not fit the stereotype , and 3 ) distance ourselves from the criminal in a show of “ we are not all like them ” solidarity ? why is that even necessary ? when a deranged white male , or angry white male , or white male who “ had a really bad day ” commits a crime , why does he represent himself and himself alone , and not an entire race of people ? at the very least , where is the devout christian community to say , “ he does not represent all christians ? ” the bedrock of racism and all isms is low expectations of an entire people based on race . people of color serve as “ racial representatives ” of every other person who looks like them . in the film skin deep , a black male eloquently explains that when one black person steals , it affects every other black person not only in the store , but in this country . stereotypes are unfairly , universally applied assumptions about an entire people , and racism is the most pernicious of the lot . when one asian american shooter gunned down several students at virginia tech , in that moment he represented all asian people . that is racism . that is how racism works . white people get to be individuals , lone wolves , and act on their own behalves . most importantly , their individual actions do not translate into the wrong assumptions , unfair treatment , and suspicion of all white people . when the coronavirus was found to have origins in china , it affected all asian people irrespective of ethnicity . vietnamese , thai , hmong , laotian , japanese , filipino , and all manner of asian americans and asian american pacific islanders have been implicated in violent , race-based attacks and hate crimes . as someone who is thai and south asian indian , i am no more chinese that someone who is white or european american . what endangers my 72 year-old asian mother and me , however , is that we look asian , and that is quite enough to be targeted for hate . asian americans have literally been assaulted in the street , pepper sprayed , spat upon , and even killed during the pandemic . we are not chinese , and even if we were , we are not responsible for the covid-19 pandemic . neither individually nor collectively . we have seen “ bat fried rice ” t-shirts , and the very same captain jay baker who now famously empathized with the white killer in atlanta who “ had a bad day ” posted to his social media account an urgent call ( “ love my shirt ! get yours while they last ! ” ) to purchase t-shirts that read , “ covid-19 : imported from chy-na. ” throughout the pandemic , we have seen every asian american grow increasingly subject to hate , violence , and even fatal attacks based solely on their asianness . their “ chineseness ” is irrelevant because our chinese community members are not the scapegoat of a global health emergency either . irrespective of how this started , we are all in this together . white men get to have a bad day because whiteness and white individuality heavily works in their favor . when a white man commits a crime , it is seen as aberrant , surprising , and totally out of keeping from an otherwise peaceful existence . white men represent themselves , so no one is more afraid of a white christian man in the aftermath of the atlanta shootings in the same way that they have always been afraid of my black brother . when your skin color is a weapon , you are never unarmed . how whiteness works : an honest dialogue leads to honest change when a white person is in a position of power and is overrepresented in almost every seat of power in the united states , that is somehow seen as unproblematic and largely unworthy of interrogation . what is suspicious and outrageous , however , is when a black and asian woman ascends to the second highest seat of american political power and shakes our very notion of what leaders and vice presidents look like . when a white person is asked “ what they are , ” or “ where they are from , ” they are free to just say…whatever they like . there are no hyphens — physically or philosophically — separating them from their americanness because in this country , whiteness and americanness are one in the same . when a white man commits a crime , he acts on his own behalf . he is a lone wolf . a bullied boy . a troubled teen . a white man who just really “ had a bad day ” but is otherwise assumed to be nonviolent , innocent , upstanding , law-abiding , and “ naturally ” devoid of criminal tendencies . there will be no counsel of american white men called upon to defend his actions , separate themselves from his behavior , apologize for his violence , or reassure the public of their benevolent intentions toward this country . there will be no such representative meeting because white people represent themselves . they do not represent every other white person because white people are viewed as individuals and not lumped together as a racialized group . understanding the atlanta shootings in the context of whiteness , white racial dominance , and white normalcy in the american imagination is a far more honest way of moving forward than excusing , exculpating , and infantilizing every white murderer who victimizes people of color . i have written about how outraged people of all ilk can stand in solidarity with us — blacks , asians , women — so i dare not repeat myself here . what i also wish not to see repeated is this cycle of wayward white shooter , subsequent sob story , “ i can ’ t believe it ! ” character-building testimonies , lone gunman , calls for mental health reform , villainize the victims of color in the media… with your well-warranted outrage and a a brief glimpse of how whiteness works , please do better , america . we are exhausted . dr. taharee jackson is

medium_antiracist_27885,"freddie gray : the missing element one-third of people killed by police are people with disabilities : important to understand significance that gray ’ s disability had in leading to his death washington , may 23 — as the verdict comes down on the death of freddie gray in police custody in baltimore , the first trial of his accused killers has come to an end . one of six officers charged in connection with the arrest and subsequent death of gray last april was acquitted . however , more attention needs to be paid to the fact that gray was an individual with a disability and the role disability played in his involvement with the justice system . while we are still trying to understand the full ramifications of lead poisoning , advocates and studies say it can diminish cognitive function , increase aggression and ultimately exacerbate the cycle of poverty that is already exceedingly difficult to break . gray ’ s death exemplifies the complexities of looking at the intersections of risk factors — including disability and racism . unaddressed disability issues left him vulnerable to becoming trapped in the school-to-prison pipeline and criminalization . lead paint poisoning , like other environmental issues including fetal alcohol syndrome ( fas ) , can cause an inability to follow multi-step instructions . it is vital for children with these issues to receive single-step instructions and other accommodations until they can learn how to follow multi-step instructions . early intervention , while brains are still literally shaping and can rewire , is key . that is because significant improvements in “ executive function ” and other abilities can be achieved . however , when such a disability is not properly diagnosed and addressed , as happens all too often in single parent , minority and other families , an outcome can be “ unexpected behaviors ” in school . this , as was the case with mr. gray , may lead to school suspensions , failure to complete high school and a greater risk of falling into the justice system . freddie gray ’ s disability did not kill him . however , the lack of an early diagnosis and appropriate supports made it harder for him to complete school . moreover , gray ’ s death was not an isolated incident , as there are numerous public examples of a high profile death where disability was a factor . as recorded by historian david perry and disability expert lawrence carter-long in a white paper for the ruderman family foundation , tamir rice , sandra bland , quintonio legrier , robert ethan saylor and many others whose stories caught national attention were people with disabilities . more recently , news broke about a young man with a psychiatric disability named jamycheal mitchell who starved to death in police custody . likewise , many children in flint , michigan are being diagnosed with a variety of intellectual and developmental disabilities due to lead poisoning in the water . “ flint is a perfect storm of racism and classism coming together in an insidious storm to create and perpetuate ableism , racism , and classism , ” blogger cara liebowitz wrote following a democratic presidential primary debate in the city . people with disabilities , especially minorities , are among the most vulnerable when it comes to poverty , exploitation , victimization and violence . we need more sustained analysis into ways structural and individual ableism leads to the victimization of vulnerable individuals . we can not fix these problems unless we confront all the forms of oppression that intersect to ruin lives , absorb vast sums of money and shatter dreams . disability is a critical part of that equation .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_30955,"black lives matter and psychology the black lives matter movement has a beneficial fallout-factor of social good similar to the civil rights movement and other social change movements of the past ( carey , 2006 ) . what this means is despite centering upon the experience of black citizens with police brutality , profiling , and implicit bias , the success of the movement would benefit american society as a whole . any marginalized group experiencing brutality and bias from law enforcement and the judicial system would benefit ( rickford , 2016 ) . furthermore , these advantages of social change would have a positive effect on their psychological and physical health and quality of life . the desire for justice would beget fulfillment of the natural expectation for individual respect and freedom from fear of abuse of authority and death ( christie , 2006 ; kriesberg , 2007 ) . the general concept of safety is heavily grounded in the psychological and emotional state of feeling safe . if this factor were used as a measure of the outcome of social movements such as the black lives matter movement , would it be fair ? as emotions and psychological states can be viewed as a relative and individual experience , we can not deny the existence of collective psychological and emotional states within groups ( hoffman , granger , vallejos & moats , 2016 ; zomeran , spears , & leach , 2008 ) . the black lives matter movement springs from the black community ’ s collective trauma of consistent unjust treatment and death at the hands of law enforcement ( bar-tal , halperin , & de rivera , 2007 ; kriesberg , 2007 ) . therefore , an additional psychological goal of the black lives matter movement is to alleviate the devastating effects of collective trauma while creating the foundation of positive and just social interactions between the black community and nation-wide law enforcement . moreover , these psychological effects can also manifest as physical ailments . the hope for achieving this goal is tremendous because living in fear is not living at all . it is the act of waiting for what seems to be inevitable : an untimely death at the hands of law enforcement with no recourse for justice because of the unchangeableness of your skin color . references bar‐tal , d. , halperin , e. , & de rivera , j .

medium_antiracist_41531,"ethical consumption under capitalism ? what was initially meant to be a criticism of the capitalist economic system is now commonly used by many as a redundant statement to justify overconsumption to the detriment and complete disregard of the working class and all the non-human animals that are directly or indirectly harmed in the production of commodities . the statement “ there is no ethical consumption under capitalism ” tends to get thrown around whenever people are asked to look at the processes behind producing the commodities we consume and the effects it has on workers and non-human animals . the means of production are the technology , tools , resources and facilities needed to produce the goods that workers create . capitalism is the economic and political system in which the world operates , where the means of production is privately owned for the purposes of amassing profit for a class of people known as the ‘ bourgeoisie ’ . wealth — and , subsequently , profit — do not come into existence on its own ; earth ’ s natural resources , which are also mostly privately owned , are utilized and processed by workers to create goods . most goods produced are owned neither by the workers who produce them nor the people from whom the resources were appropriated ; it is the owner of the means of production who becomes the owner of the goods produced by the workers . capitalism is fundamentally rooted in the exploitation of labor by capital , and the private ownership of the means of production . ethical consumption is the attempt to make mindful consumer choices to reduce an individual ’ s impact on the environment , the exploitation of workers , and , if they happen to be vegan , the exploitation of non-human animals . originally , the phrase “ there is no ethical consumption under capitalism ” highlighted the fact that with all labor being exploited by capitalists , no consumption under capitalism could ever be regarded as ethical . ironically , this fact is often subverted to reinforce capitalism by people who have an interest in maintaining their consumer behaviors . it is not just the bourgeoisie , also known as the capitalist class , that uphold this system , but also ( typically ) those who can afford to be effective consumers ; this is reflected in the general apathy and even disdain for workers and migrants from poorer nations . precarious and disenfranchised workers — who are disproportionately from the global south and , therefore , bipoc ( black , indigenous and people of color ) — are hyper-exploited in what is offhandedly described as “ low-skill work ” to produce consumer goods and commodities . additionally , in the race to amass as much profit as possible , non-human animals are exploited and killed at an exponential rate . it is important to note that the agricultural revolution occurred in britain ( mid-17th to late 19th century ) , whose economy relied on slavery and colonialism ; the practice of intensive farming was first developed in the 20th century and has only become more “ efficient ” at the expense of sentient lives and the environment ever since . imperialism , as described by lenin , is the highest stage of capitalism . in the earlier stages of capitalism , free-market competition drove the economy . this kind of freedom , of course , was upheld over the freedom of colonized people in their right to self-determination . imperialism develops out of free market competition . simply put , “ imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism ” ( lenin , 1916 ) . as the bourgeoisie compete amongst themselves for the ownership of production and the accumulation of capital , both capital and the means of production inevitably become concentrated in the hands of a few . lenin explains that capital from industry and capital from banks merge to become “ finance capital ” , which is then exported to underdeveloped territories/nations for the purposes of further exploitation and search for profits . this development of capitalism to such a stage means that a system of monopoly domination is what drives the economy ; it is no longer free market competition . imperialist nations assert political power and economic domination over non-imperialist nations by means of exporting finance capital , installing governments against the will of the people , and using military power to suppress liberation movements . the us , uk and the eu bloc are fundamentally imperialist ; they all have a neo-colonial relationship with most non-imperial nations . kwame nkrumah explains that neo-colonialism is where once colonized territories/nations are still economically dependent on — and , therefore , have their political policy controlled by — imperialists , all the while appearing to be independent states ( nkrumah , 1965 ) . furthermore , the us , canada , israel , and australia are examples of settler colonial states . colonizers seize and occupy land that is already inhabited by natives/indigenous people and commit acts of genocide , such as destroying subsistence farms with the intent to kill them through starvation or through outright massacres and displacement . for example : • after his “ discovery of the new world ” in 1492 , christopher columbus returned to the caribbean islands the following year with a fleet to subjugate , enslave and exterminate the native peoples . “ columbus ’ s programs reduced taino numbers from as many as eight million at the outset of his regime to about three million in 1496 . perhaps 100,000 were left by the time of the governor ’ s departure . his policies , however , remained , with the result that by 1514 the spanish census of the island showed barely 22,000 indians remaining alive . in 1542 , only two hundred were recorded . thereafter , they were considered extinct , as were indians throughout the caribbean basin , an aggregate population which totalled more than fifteen million at the point of first contact with the admiral of the ocean sea , as columbus was known. ” ( churchill , 1994 ) • the seventh president of the united states , andrew jackson , signed the indian removal act into law in 1830 , which allowed the “ resettlement ” ( displacement ) of indigenous people in mississippi from the land they lived in to unsettled land in the west of the state . approximately 100 cherokee leaders signed the treaty of new echota , where they were promised provisions and benefits in return for relinquishing all the land east of the mississippi river . this was used to justify the forcible removal of almost 17,000 cherokees in 1838 . “ an estimated 4,000 died from hunger , exposure and disease . the journey became a cultural memory as the ‘ trail where they cried ’ for the cherokees and other removed tribes . today it is widely remembered by the general public as the ‘ trail of tears ’ . ” ( cherokee nation , 2019 ) . • settler colonialism is an ongoing process so long as the settler/native relationship exists . the settler colonial regimes against natives/indigenous peoples operate to this day , not only in the us and canada , but also in palestine . among the daily injustices of being second-class citizens , palestinians in the west bank continue to have their lands encroached by settlers — mainly through house demolitions , which have happened since the six-day war in 1967 , and attacks on farms . “ in just over two months , from the beginning of may to 7 july 2018 , b ’ tselem documented 10 instances in which settlers destroyed a total of more than 2,000 trees and grapevines and burned down a barley field and bales of hay. ” ( b ’ tselem , 2018 ) imperialism does not only affect humans , however ; land encroachment by imperialist powers for the purposes of animal agriculture , resource extraction , and trophy hunting are examples of ways non-human animals are also harmed by this system . these practices that only seek to extract profits for a minority , not for the benefit of humans , are driving the sixth mass species extinction . imperialism exposes the ugly nature of the animal agriculture as we develop production to such a stage that billions of animals can be bred into existence just to squeeze as much profit out as possible , with absolutely no regard for sentient life . the definition of speciesism differs depending on who wants to define it . unfortunately , when defined by single-issue vegans , it is used to dismiss the struggles of marginalized and oppressed people . the issue with defining speciesism as merely human supremacy over animals ( and trying to draw equivalence to racism and misogyny from it ) is that it dismisses the historical factors in the development of our species in relation to non-human animals and obfuscates the social , political and economic relations we have with each other . single-issue vegans see speciesism as the most overriding oppression , as opposed to one of the many forms of oppression that is tied to capitalism , and mistakenly believe that being vegan absolves them of benefiting from speciesism and other kinds of systemic oppression . this reductive , individualist approach is often used to dismiss any form of accountability by white vegans in their role under capitalism , which is inherently white supremacist , patriarchal and speciesist . historically , as a species , homo sapiens have hunted/domesticated animals for food , clothing and transport ; we can not erase this fact , nor should we use this as means to justify exploitation where exploitation is not necessary . in the present day , many of us live in societies where the level of production is advanced to the point that we do not have to hunt/farm non-human animals , and where the knowledge of thriving without exploiting animals is accessible , even though there are interests that run disinformation campaigns or promote biased research to protect animal agricultural industries ( pippus , 2017 ) . speciesism , therefore , is the exploitation of non-human animals by humans where exploitation is not necessary for survival . what is the significance behind imperialism and settler colonialism with regards to speciesism ? the endangerment of wild non-human species is a result of colonial aggression for domination , and conservation projects to protect these now-endangered animals becomes another tool for settlers to occupy land and sever the tie indigenous/native people have with land . in the west , for example : “ the model of conservation derived from settler colonialism is predicated on the threat of extermination made possible by the disruption of relationships among beings . in other words , it is the translation of land ( rich with dynamic and interlocking relationships ) into habitat ( situated for the survival of a single or hierarchical set of species ) . in this sense , conservation is not just about sustaining a place , and its ways and species , or even a species itself , but about conserving the endurance of the settler colonial project , a way of life that individuates by separation , eliminates through replacement , and sustains through domination. ” ( burow , 2017 ) the economic and political complexities surrounding our everyday lives are easy to dismiss if one benefits from such injustices and oppression . the reality is that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism because all labor is exploited by the ruling class who profit from it . however , this does not give one free reign over perpetuating or upholding the capitalist system and , therefore , siding with oppressive forces . the phrase was meant to engage critical thought towards economic production — not to dismiss it . capitalism is inherently destructive and oppressive ; it keeps the majority systematically disadvantaged , working to produce wealth that is then appropriated by the bourgeoisie , all the while destroying ecosystems and the environment in the process . there can be no liberation for bipoc/women/workers ( it is important to remember that these groups of people are not mutually exclusive ) under capitalism . it is imperative that we address these issues through organized , politicized boycotts and resistance to capitalism . we must show solidarity with people currently resisting colonialism/imperialism globally whether they are currently pursuing animal rights or not , while creating the conditions that allow people to engage with the concept of consistent anti-oppression . lenin , v ( 1916 ) . imperialism , the highest stage of capitalism . progress publishers , moscow . nkrumah , k.

 i 'd say there are two things that might be helpful to focus on : 

 1 . ) minority affairs office is n't the only place for assistance .   this is less for you and more in general - but most colleges have women 's groups for instance , and there 's the general financial aid offices as well .   it may also help to know that us white people get more than our share of financial assistance overall - we make up a bit more than half of all college enrollment in the us but we get about 2/3rds of all scholarships and scholarship dollars .   so while "" affirmative action "" programs did n't help you and others can fall through the cracks too , there are so many assistance options out there , it seems unreasonable for people to get mad at that one specifically . 

 2 . ) an instance of affirmative action not working * for * someone is not the same thing as it working * against * them .   the ma office and affirmative action did nothing to make your college time more difficult than it would have been if the office did n't exist at all , so it did not work against you .

though it did not affect the outcome of the case for which phelps had requested the transcript , phelps still requested $ 22,000 in damages from her . in the ensuing trial , phelps called brady to the stand , declared her a hostile witness , and then cross-examined her for nearly a week , during which he accused her of being a “ slut , ” tried to introduce testimony from former boyfriends whom phelps wanted to subpoena , and accused her of a variety of perverse sexual acts , ultimately reducing her to tears on the stand . phelps lost the case ; according to the kansas supreme court .",medium_antiracist

 police go and kill more white people than blacks per year but in percentages kill more blacks ! this gives us an appearance of evil racist cops ! even if more white people are killed by the cops in total ! i doubt the whole police force goes out with the intention of killing blacks only ! what i am trying to explain is that there is evil racist cops among the police force but evidence suggests that the police force itself is not racist as a whole ! there is those racist assholes among the police that destroy the reputation of the entire force !

reddit_antiracist_54692,"looking at the us drug laws from 30,000 ft , they are designed to have the upper echelon of our society have control over the lower . add to this the raciest characters who imposed these rules , the words officials use when they describe the laws , and the overwhelming enforcement of these laws on black communities , i have no doubt that these laws are supported by the faction of racist white populations who fought and lost to keep the tradition of jim crow . 

 first , the racist history . at the federal level ( i am only talking about the federal level ) , the first laws banning a substance was the harrison narcotics act . the two drugs banned were cocaine and opium . both drugs were banned to protect the sanctity of women . women would become addicted to the opium after being prescribed it for menstruation pain . coke on the other hand , was indirectly harmful to women . the belief was that black southern men high on coke were raping white women in the south , while also improving their pistol marksmanship . [ read source   president wilson ( a southern democrat ) signed the bill , as one of his earliest expansions of federal power . this is no question in my mind , that in the jim crow south , drug use among blacks has a racist history . 

 second , is the words that officials use to describe them . looking at nixon , there is more than a fair amount of literature that describes his racist intent coupled with his want to go after anti - war protesters . it is easier to justify silencing someone for breaking an illegal substance law then it is to justify silencing them for speaking out against a war or civil rights . this famous quote by john ehrlichman , nixon 's domestic policy advisor , put it better than i could 

 & # x200b ; 

 > “ you want to know what this was really all about ? ” he asked with the bluntness of a man who , after public disgrace and a stretch in federal prison , had little left to protect . “ the nixon campaign in 1968 , and the nixon white house after that , had two enemies : the antiwar left and black people . you understand what i ’m saying ? we knew we could n’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black , but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin , and then criminalizing both heavily , we could disrupt those communities . we could arrest their leaders , raid their homes , break up their meetings , and vilify them night after night on the evening news . did we know we were lying about the drugs ? of course we did . ” 

 here is [ hilary clinton and her   talking about her husbands attempts to "" take back our streets from crime , gangs , and drugs "" with his "" anti - crime , anit - gang , anti - drug effort "" . it is clear who she means , and these phrases are the modern equivalents of what you would have read in southern newspapers in 1900 . 

 third , the result . the numbers can be researched by yourself easily , and it goes beyond the murder rate . black people have higher incarceration rates , higher rates of felony convictions per arrest , longer times served . everything . there is no question that these laws in practice have targeted people of color more than any other nationality of people in our nation . these laws may not spell out their intended targets , just like the voting laws in the 1890 mississippi constitution or the jim crow convict leasing programs , but they are intended , at least in part , to be a tool . in this way , the war on drugs has been a wild success .",reddit_antiracist

 in sociology , individual racism , commonly what racism is defined as ( racism performed by one person to another ) is referred to as prejudice or racial prejudice . some people do use soley the sociological term to say that minorities can not be racist , though whether this is misunderstanding stipulatives , or disingenuous varies form person to person .

 edit : sorry , i re - read your comment . here ’s the contents of the condensed version for you : 


 there is no skirting around the fact that black lives matter and protesters in our little town have absorbed much of our focus and attention lately . i saw a question which was repeated over and over on local social media that i felt compelled to try to answer . 
 “ why here in canal fulton ? ” 
 it ’s absolutely a great question . however , i feel the answer to this question lies in a brief walk through history and not in just a couple typed sentences . 
 we declared our independence on july 4 , 1776 , but i feel we were not a “ free ” nation until we ratified the 13th amendment in 1865 which outlawed slavery . 
 however , was the african - american race truly a free race after that day ? free of racism and discrimination ? there was no 14th amendment that gave citizenship to blacks as of yet , nor the 15th amendment denying a male black citizen the right to vote ( which did n’t mean much for african americans until the voting rights act of 1965 ) , or plessy v. ferguson that advanced the “ separate but equal ” doctrine , or the supreme court ruling in brown v. the board of education in 1954 that barred racial segregation of children in public schools . 
 the only thing the newly freed slave owned was the color of their skin which led to further degradation and feelings of inferiority . african - americans had little family , religion , education , or wealth to go with their newly found freedoms nor to rectify the generations of wrongs they received . 
 they were in no position to stop what was coming next , which was a century filled with practices of discrimination , racism , segregation , and manipulating african - americans of being inferior to the white supremacy . 
 so what does all of this have to do with our little town ? how is this answering the question about , “ why here in canal fulton ? ” 
 that was all long time ago , right ? dr. martin luther king jr. talked about a two - part process of freeing the slaves . 


 first was granting the enslaved their freedom but second was the integration process into society . something , i believe , we are still dealing with today . 
 just think about the fact that it was only 56 years ago when the jim crow laws which segregated blacks on buses , restaurants , swimming pools , and libraries were finally considered illegal . everyone on this earth older than 56 years of age , lived in a time when african- americans were barred from using bathrooms that were labeled , “ whites only . ” 
 what message do you think that sent our parents and grandparents ? 
 i do not know or believe that there is a law today that is discriminatory ( i hope not ) , but that does not mean that we do n’t have to move resources to help fix the atrocities that occurred just a few short decades ago . 


 to do this , african - americans are going to need the vast majority of support ( votes ) to help enact legislation which will help move critical resources and funding into areas such as our educational and housing systems . 
 that means you and me here in canal fulton . that means protesting in little towns to help bring awareness to these issues that are still in the shadows of the discriminatory practices occurring in the 1960s . that means our citizens helping to understand what african - americans in other communities are currently struggling with as it will be our vote and support that helps . 
 together , if we are willing , we can admit that maybe the integration process has not yet been completed . with love and compassion , versus violence and hatred , we can create a better america for everyone . 


 it begins by active listening and the understanding of our long - term goals , even well past our own lives , as well as history ’s misdeeds . recognizing the rights of everyone including the right to peacefully protest , wherever and whenever , is a key element of fostering change for any good cause . 
 in no way do i condone the rioting and violent protests nor the belief that we should abolish the police . this is only causing further division and hate . those calls and actions are based upon a manifest of an extremely small percentage of america who have goals other than martin luther king ’s vision of a harmony among our races . 
 yes , we have come a long way since the enslaved were freed a century - and - a - half - ago , but there are many laps ahead to finishing a marathon of true integration . we are all in this marathon together , side by side . with true compassion , love , and understanding we can all cross the finish line together . 
 i hope i have somehow brought light upon the question posed earlier in this article about , “ why here in canal fulton ? ” with knowledge of the aforementioned , i can now answer this question more easily . 

 the answer is that the black community needs us . also , if we truly seek fulfillment in our lives , the white community also needs the black community just as much , if not more . our continuously intersecting lives will always be contentious if we do n’t stop and take time to actively listen to one another and understand . 
 i believe integration will be complete once people in the ghettos of harlem understand the people in small town canal fulton and vice versa . we can take the first step by supporting the non - violent protesting slated to occur in our small town and listening to the message they want to deliver .

( shortened link for sharing : http : //bit.ly/2ayjnk2 ) அன்புள்ள நண்பர்களே , குடும்பத்தினர்களே , ஒரு முதன்மையான விடயம் பற்றி நான் உங்களோடு கதைக்க வேண்டும . கறுப்பு இன மக்கள் எனது வாழ்வில் ஒரு முக்கிய அங்கமாக இருக்கின்றார்கள் . இவர்கள் எனது நண்பர்கள் , என்னோடு படிப்பவர்கள் , என்னோடு பணிபுரிபவர்கள் , ஏறத்தாழ இவர்கள் எனது சக குடும்பத்தினர் போன்றவர்களாவர் . இன்று அவர்களது நிலையை நினைத்தால் எனக்கு அச்சமாகவும் , கவலையாகவும் இருக்கிறது . ஜூலை 2016 ல் , alton sterling என்ற கறுப்பு இனத்தவர் ஒரு கடைக்கு முன்பு இறுவட்டு ( சீடி ) விற்றுக் கொண்டிருந்த பொழுது அமெரிக்க காவல்துறையால் சுட்டுக் கொல்லப்பட்டார் . இந்த சம்பவம் நடந்ததிற்கு அடுத்த நாள் philando castile என்ற இன்னொரு கறுப்பு இனத்தவர் பயணம் செய்துகொண்டிருந்த வாகனத்தின் மின் விளக்கு உடைந்து இருந்ததற்காக அமெரிக்க காவல் துறையால் விசாரணைக்காக தடுத்து நிறுத்தப்பட்ட போது அவரது காதலி மற்றும் நான்கு வயதுப் பிள்ளை முன்னே வாகனத்திற்கு உள்ளே இருக்கும் போதே சுட்டுக் கொல்லப்பட்டார் . 2016 ல் 500 க்கும் மேற்பட்டவர்கள் கொல்லப்பட்டுள்ளனர் . இது 25 % கருப்பு . எனினும் அமெரிக்க மக்கள் தொகையில் கறுப்பு இனத்தவர்13 % மட்டுமே . கனடாவிலும் கறுப்பின மக்களும் ; பூர்வீக குடியினரும் காவல்துறையினரால் ஓரவஞ்சனையாகக் குறிவைக்கப்பட்டு , வன்முறைக்கு உள்ளாக்கிச் சிறையில் தள்ளப்படுகின்றனர . அண்மையில் கனடாக் காவல் துறையினர் andrew loku , jermaine carby , abdi hirsi , மற்றும் jean-pierre bony என்னும் கறுப்பின ஆண்களின் உயிரைப் பறித்துள்ளனர் . மேலும் இந்தப் பெயர்களை விட இன்னமும் வெளியே சொல்லப்படாத கனேடிய காவல்த்துறையின் வன்முறைக்கு உள்ளாக்கப்பட்ட கறுப்பினத்தவர்கள் , பூர்வீகக் குடிப்பெண்கள , மற்றும் lbtqiaயினரின் சோகக் கதைகள் அதிகமுண்டு . பெரும்பான்மையான சந்தர்ப்பங்களில் இதற்காகக் காவல் துறையினர் எந்தவித விழைவுகளையும் எதிர்கொள்ளவில்லை . எமது கறுப்பின நண்பர்கள் பலர் இப்படிப்பட்ட அச்சமான நிலையில் நாள்தோறும் ;

யதார்த்தத்தை விளங்கிக் கொள்ளவிடாது தடுக்கிறது . பொதுவாக காவல்துறையினர் ஒரு கறுப்பினத்தவரை சுடும் போது நாம் இலகுவாகவே அந்த நபரைக் குற்றவாளியெனக் கருதுகிறோம் . இதற்குக் காரணமாக ஊடகங்களிலும் எங்கள் வீடுகளிலும் இவர்களைப் பற்றிப் பேசப்படும் எதிர்மறைக் கருத்துக்கள் அமைகின்றன . எனவே இவற்றின் மீதான எனது பார்வையை , நான் எப்படி இவற்றையெல்லாம் விளங்கிக்கொள்கின்றேன் , என்பதை உங்களுடன் பகிர்ந்து கொள்ளுவதன் மூலம் நீங்களும் இவற்றை அவ்வாறு பார்ப்பீர்களென நம்புகின்றேன் . தென் ஆசிய-கனடியர்களான நாம் , பல வேளைகளில் இந்த நாட்டில் , எம்மீதான பல பாகுபாடுகளை பார்த்திருக்கிறோம் . நாம் பின்பற்றும் வேறுபட்ட கலாச்சார பாரம்பரியங்களுக்காக பிறரால் பரிகசிக்கப்பட்டுள்ளோம் . வேலைத்தளங்களில் , எமது தாயகக்கல்வித் தகமைகள் இங்கு போதாது என சொல்லிச் சம வாய்ப்புக்கள் மறுக்கப்பட்டுள்ளதுடன் உயர்பதவிகளுக்குத்

ஏற்பட்ட மன அதிர்ச்சிக்கும் வறுமைக்கும் முகங் கொடுத்து வாழ்ந்தோம் . எமது சமூகங்களுக்குள்ளேயே நாம் சாதி , பால் , வருமானம் , பாலியல் நாட்டம் , மற்றும் தோல் நிறச் சாயல் , போன்ற பல காரணிகளால் ஒடுக்கு முறைக்கு உள்ளாக்கப்பட்டோம் . ஆயினும் கறுப்பினத்தவர்களுக்கு நடக்கின்ற அளவுக்கு காவல் காவல்துறை நமது குழந்தைகளையும் தாய் -தந்தையரையும் சுட்டுக்கொல்வதில்லை . ஒப்பீட்டளவில் வேலைத்தளங்களிலோ , வீட்டு உரிமையாளர்களோ , மற்றும் நிறுவனங்களோ எம்மை சிறப்பாகவே நடத்துகின்றன . கறுப்பு நிற நண்பர்களுடைய வாழ்க்கை அனுபவம் எம்மைப் போன்றதாக அமையாததற்கு பல காரணங்கள் உள்ளன . நீங்கள் ; இதைப்பற்றி அறிந்திருப்பதற்கான

முடிந்த பின்பும் அவர்களுடைய வாழ்க்கை முன்னேற பெரிய அளவில் எந்தவித உதவியோ ஒத்தாசையோ செய்ய யாரும் முன்வரவில்லை . இன்றும் அவர்களுடைய வாழ்க்கை வன்முறையின் நிழலிலேயே இருக்கிறது . நாம் வாழும் சமுகத்திற்கோ சட்டத்தின் முன்னோ நாமும் சமமானவர்கள் என்ற நிலையை அடைவதற்காக தொடர்ச்சியாக போராடிக் கொண்டே இருக்கவேண்டியுள்ளது . கறுப்பின செயற்பாட்டாளர்கள் தங்களுடைய உரிமைக்குப் போராடும் வேளையில் கறுப்பு இனத்தவருக்கு மட்டுமின்றி அனைவருடைய உரிமைகளுக்காகவும் சேர்ந்தே போராடுகின்றார்கள் . தனி மனித சுதந்திரங்களை பாதுகாத்து பேணவேண்டுமென்பதை அரசாங்கத்திற்கு வலியுறுத்தும் போராட்டங்களின் போது பலர் அடிக்கப்பட்டும் , சிறையில் அடைக்கப்பட்டும் , கொல்லப்பட்டுமுள்ளனர் . இன்று கனடாவில் தென்னாசிய சமுகங்களாகிய நாம் அனுபவிக்கும் பல உரிமைகள் இவர்களது முயற்சியால் கிடைக்கப் பெற்றன . இவர்களுக்கு நாம் கடமைப்பட்டுள்ளோம் . நாம் எமக்குள் போட்டியிடுவோம் என எதிர்பார்க்கும் இந்தப் பொது அநிதியான கட்டமைப்புக்களுக்கு எதிராக நாம் எல்லோருமே இணைந்து போராடுவோம் . எம்மைப் போலவே நமது குடும்பங்களுக்கு நல்ல எதிர்காலத்தை உருவாக்கவே அதிகமான கறுப்பினத்தவர் கனடாவிற்கு அகதிகளாகவும் குடிவரவாளராகவும் வந்தார்கள் . இந்த வகையில் எம்மையும் அவர்களையும் பல பொது சவால்கள் ஒன்று இணைத்திருக்கின்றன . முற்கூறிய காரணங்களுக்காக நான் கறுப்பினத்தாரின் விடுதலைக்காக குரல் கொடுக்கும் இந்த black lives matter என்ற இயக்கத்துக்கும் எனைய இதே நோக்கம் கொண்ட அமைப்புக்களையும் ஆதரிக்கிறேன் . இதன் அடிப்படையில் எனது சமூகத்தில் எனது குடும்பத்தில் கறுப்பினத்தவர்

நம்மைப்போன்ற மனிதரே ஆவர் . அவர்கள் எல்லோரையும்விடக் குறைந்தவர்கள் என்று கருதுவது தவறு ஆகும் . தங்கள் நிறம் காரணமாக தங்களுடைய குழந்தை , தாய் , தந்தை , நண்பர் , உற்றார் , உறவினரை காவல் துறையினரது வன்முறையின் காரணமாக இழந்துள்ள கறுப்பு நிறத்தவரின் ஆத்திரத்தையும் வருத்தத்தையும் மாந்த நேயத்தோடும் பரிவோடும் நோக்குமாறு கேட்டுக்கொள்கிறேன் . அவர்களுக்காக போராட்டத்தில் கலந்து ஆதரவு அளிக்குமாறு

எனினும் எனது கோபத்தையும் கவலையையும் விளங்கி நான் போராட்டத்தில் இறங்கி குரல் கொடுக்கும் போது எனக்கு ஆறுதலாக இருப்பீர்களென நம்புகிறேன் . எம்மை பாதுகாக்க வேண்டிய சமூகக் கட்டமைப்புகளால் எமது கறுப்பின மற்றும் பூர்வீகக் குடி சகோதர சகோதரிகளுக்கு நாளாந்தம் ஆபத்துக்கள் வரும் போது நல்ல மனச்சாட்சி உள்ள மனிதர்கள் ஒருபோதும் அநீதியை கண்டு அமைதியாய் இருக்கமாட்டார்கள் . தமிழ் சமூகத்தின் ஒரு உறுப்பினர் என்ற

பிள்ளைகள் , எதிர்வரும் தலைமுறையினர் , தாம் இந்த நாட்டில் அனுபவித்த கஷ்டங்களை அனுபவிக்கக் கூடாது என்பதற்காக , கனடாவில் இருக்கின்ற எத்தனையோ வகையான பாரபாட்சங்களுக்கும் முகம் கொடுத்து , தம்மிலும் விட தமது

நோக்குவேன் . அந்த நல்வாழ்க்கையை அமைத்துக்கொள்ள நீங்கள் பட்ட துன்பங்களை நானும் படவேண்டாம் என்று என்னை நீங்கள் பாதுகாப்பதையும் நன்றாக அறிவேன் . நல்வாழ்க்கை என்னும் கனவு உங்களுடைய குழந்தைகளுக்கு மட்டும் கிடைத்தால் போதும் என்று நினைப்பது தவறு என்ற உண்மையை நீங்கள் கருத்தில் கொள்ளவேண்டும . ; நல்வாழ்க்கை என்ற கனவு அனைவருக்கும் சம உரிமையானது . எனவே நாம் எல்லோரும் இணைந்து இந்த கனடா நாட்டில் , காவல்துறையின் வன்முறைகளுக்கோ , இனவாதத்துக்கோ , மற்றும் ஏனைய பாகுபாடுகளுக்கோ , பலருமே உள்ளாகாத வகையிலான ஒரு சமூகத்தை கட்டியெழுப்புவோம் . அப்படியான ஒர் எதிர்காலத்தையே நான் வேண்டுகிறேன் . அதையே நீங்களும் வேண்டுவீர்கள் என்றும் நம்புகிறேன் . அன்புடனும் நம்பிக்கையுடனும் , கறுப்பினத்தவரின் உயிருக்கும் உரிமைக்கும் ஆதரவான தமிழர்கள் — this is the tamil version of the open ​letters​ created by letters for black lives , an ongoing project for people in ​the us and canada​ to create and translate resources on anti-blackness for their communities in solidarity with # blacklivesmatter ​and other movements for black liberation​ . the letters were written and translated collaboratively by hundreds of people who want to have honest and respectful conversations with their ​families and communities​ about an issue important to them . dear friends and family , there ’ s something important that i want to talk to you about . black people are a significant part of my life : they are my friends , my classmates , my colleagues , my partners , and my family . and i am scared for them . police in the united states killed a black man named alton sterling while he was selling cds in front of a store in july of 2016 . the next day , police killed another black man , philando castile , after pulling him over for a broken tail light while his girlfriend and four-year-old daughter were in the car . this year , of the more than 500 people already killed by u.s. police , 25 % were black , even though black people make up 13 % of the population . in canada , black and indigenous people are also negatively stereotyped , targeted and treated violently by the police , and are over-represented in prisons . canadian police have recently claimed the lives of andrew loku , jermaine carby , abdi hirsi , and jean-pierre bony — all black men . these names do not account for the lives of black and indigenous women and lgbtqia people whose stories of violence do not get told . overwhelmingly , police do not face any consequences for ending these lives . this is a terrifying reality that many of my black friends live with every day . even as we hear about the dangers that black people face , our instinct is sometimes to point at the ways we are different from them , and to shield ourselves from their reality instead of empathizing . when a police officer shoots a black person , it is easy to think it is the victim ’ s fault , because we hear so many negative stereotypes about them in the media , and at our own dinner tables . i want to share with you how i have come to see things , in hopes that you may see things similarly . it is true that we face discrimination for being south asian in this country . we are ridiculed for our different cultures and practices . in the workplace , we are denied opportunities because our education from abroad is seen as inadequate or we are not thought of as “ leadership material ” . as refugees , we are detained and separated from our families for indefinite periods of time . we struggle with poverty and the trauma of wars and violence . we are even ostracized within our own communities because of caste , gender , income , sexual orientation or the hue of our skin . but it is also true that the police do not regularly gun down our children and parents for simply existing to the same extent that they do with black people . and employers , landlords and institutions often treat us better . there are reasons why our black friends experience things differently . as you may or may not have had the opportunity to learn , europeans colonized this continent , stole land and resources from indigenous peoples , and forcibly brought black people from africa as slaves . for centuries , their descendants , communities , families , and bodies were ripped apart for profit . even after slavery , they continued to be treated as less than human and were given very little support to rebuild their lives . black people had to fight for the right to be seen as equal under the law , and faced constant threats of violence , which continue to this day . in fighting for their own rights , black activists have led the movement for equality not just for themselves , but for us as well. . they have been beaten , jailed and even killed in their struggles to remind the government of its role as protector of individual liberties — many of which south asians in canada enjoy today . we owe them so much in return . we are all fighting against the same unfair system that prefers we compete against each other . many black people come to canada as immigrants or refugees , looking for a better life and safety for themselves and their families , just like many of you have . our struggles , while not all the same , are connected . for all of these reasons , i support black lives matter and other movements for black liberation . part of that means speaking up when i see people in my community — or my own family — say or do things that diminish the humanity of black people . i am telling you out of love , because i do not want this issue to divide us . i hope you join me in empathizing with the anger and grief of the parents , siblings , partners and children who have lost their loved ones to police violence . i hope you empathize with my anger and grief , and support me if i choose to be vocal or protest . i ask that you share this letter with your friends and family , and encourage them to collectively examine our prejudices and be empathetic and vocal too . i know that it can feel scary to speak up . however , we can not in good conscience stay silent while the lives of our black and indigenous brothers and sisters are endangered every day , especially by the very system that supposedly protects us . as a member of the tamil community , i am proud of our families for their long , hard journey here , and for working hard and living in a place that has not always been kind to them . they have never wished their struggles upon future generations . instead , our families have suffered through a prejudiced canada to give their children a better life than they had . we are all in this together , and we can not feel safe until all of our friends , loved ones , and neighbours are safe . we seek a place where everyone in canada can live without fear of police violence , racism , and discrimination . this is the future that i want — i hope you do too . with love and hope , tamils in support of black lives matter",medium_antiracist
reddit_antiracist_91054,"yeah , we 're pretty fucking fascist south of the border .   our state shovels propaganda down our throats as children about how the late 60s spelled the end of racism , even though in some ways it has gotten worse since then .",reddit_antiracist
reddit_antiracist_26913,"by the end of 2019 , just over 7000 us military members had been killed in iraq and afghanistan and just over 8000 us contractors had been killed , so around 15,000 killed in total in iraq and afghanistan .   but keep in mind , this includes deaths to the iraqi army , al qaeda , taliban , and isil . 



 meanwhile , it 's estimated that police kill approximately 930 - 1240 americans per year , or about 20,615 since 2001 , but the number of police killings have only been reliably tracked since 2015 ( with over 5000 deaths tracked since ) and not all law enforcement agencies are required to report killings .

 being black in a racist society means that you have an inherently shared experience that is part of your culture whether you like it or not .   being white has no such assumed connection . 

 by all means talk about races if you are talking about statistical probabilities of a connection , but when dealing with an individual do n't make any assumptions .

[ minkowicz recently announced his engagement to devora leah popack of denver , colo. ] minkowicz ’ s second connection to chabad of poway is through the brother-in-law he was visiting , rabbi shmuel marcus , whose wife , bluma , is the sister of minkowicz ’ s late wife . marcus ’ sister , also named bluma , is married to rabbi mendy rubenfeld , a member of the chabad of poway staff . the rubenfelds , who operate the center ’ s hebrew school , were away for the holiday . a police officer entered the los alamitos chabad center and informed marcus that there had been people shot at poway . because there were numerous children present , the two rabbis maintained a calm demeanor while “ freaking out ” on the inside , minkowicz said . the police officer remained for more than an hour , providing updates as he read them on his phone . “ the reality is that judaism is based on a pillar of brotherly love , ” minkowicz said . “ this was in a chabad center , but in chabad theology , our foundation is based on brotherly love . if it was a jew that was attacked , i felt the same pain as when i heard about tree of life. ” in response to the shootings at poway , “ we just try our best to provide the family comfort and mourning , and keep our heads up and move forward , ” the latter including reviewing synagogue security measures , he said . eric robbins , the chief executive of the jewish federation of greater atlanta , was worshipping at congregation shearith israel when he learned of the massacre at the tree of life , in the pittsburgh neighborhood of his youth . on sunday , the day after the poway shootings , robbins went to the chabad intown center close to his home . “ praying the morning prayers with rabbi eliyahu schusterman was comforting as we share in the tragic loss we face as a community , ” robbins said in a facebook post . “ it was the only thing i felt that i could do , ” he told the ajt . “ we are all family , when we have a loss , we get together and comfort each other . that is what we do . “ it was like salt on an open wound . i am deeply disturbed by the madness towards our community and other faith communities . i am rigorously working with clergy and leaders across our community to help our community respond and begin to heal from this tragic event , ” robbins said . schusterman , on facebook , said , “ responding to hate and darkness the chabad way ! do a mitzvah today , bring a bit more light into our world . a little bit of light pushes away a lot darkness. ” dov wilker , director of the american jewish committee regional office in atlanta , also issued a statement . “ ajc is deeply saddened by yesterday ’ s attack on the chabad of poway . we are fortunate to live in such a strong city that supports the jewish community . we hope that our political leadership will use this as an opportunity for good by using the [ congressional ] bipartisan task force for combatting anti-semitism to educate about how anti-semitism is effecting the world today , ” wilker said . the jewish federation of greater atlanta sunday night issued a statement on behalf of the southeast regional office of the anti-defamation league , the atlanta office of the american jewish committee , the atlanta rabbinical association , chabad of georgia , and the atlanta jewish community relations council . “ it was an attack on all people of faith and federation appreciates the many statements of solidarity and condolence that have come to us from christians , muslims and other faith communities in atlanta , ” the statement said . embed from getty images “ since the events in poway , cathal lucy , our director of community-wide security , has been in constant contact with federal , state , and local law enforcement along with our homeland security partners . currently , there is no information to suggest any threats to jewish institutions in atlanta . nonetheless , out of an abundance of caution , many of our area communities and municipal law enforcement agencies have reached out and tell us they ’ ve increased patrols and presence in and around the atlanta jewish community and facilities. ” looking ahead , “ we encourage everyone to attend services this coming shabbat , as jewish atlanta comes together in a solidarity shabbat. ” originally published at https : //atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com on april 29 , 2019 .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_22653,"black women pay for inequity by : monica simpson it is all too obvious to black men and women in this country that freedom is not fully available to us all . we see it every day on the news and in our communities . we see it in the fact that so many people are struggling to get by and that black children are almost four times as likely as white children to be living in poverty . we are dealing with systems that try to strip us of dignity while denying us the ability to succeed and thrive . african americans are disproportionately affected by poverty , food insecurity , and unemployment . our families are also more likely to receive emergency food assistance . it is tough to know that there are so many families struggling in my community . that is why pay equity is not just an issue of fairness and financial stability . it is an issue of survival . right now black women make only about 64 cents to every dollar that a white man earns . a black woman needs to work an extra 200 days each year . that means that we have to work from january 1 , 2014 until july 28 , 2015 to make what a white man earned by december 31 , 2014 . it is not a lack of education or training that creates this gap in pay . it is discrimination . even with the same qualifications , black women earn less . over time this inequity adds up to more than $ 19,000 per year . in a 40 year career , black women lose $ 775,000 . the wage gap also increases the likelihood that black women of retirement age are more likely to slip into poverty because their pensions and social security checks are shrunken by the years of lower pay . these numbers are dramatic , but it makes it hard to think about what it means to people in the day to day , so let ’ s use simpler terms . we are talking about more than $ 1,500 per month . that is money that could help families to make ends meet — to pay their rent and put food on the table . when women make less it puts an extra strain on us and on our families . ensuring that we each receive equal pay is key to helping to address poverty , but we need to look at systemic racism and other structural issues . due to lack of educational opportunity or a pressure to find a job where a care giver can schedule work around other responsibilities , women are often pushed into low paying occupations . we lose out when workplaces don ’ t offer paid sick time so we can care for ourselves or our loved ones without losing a day ’ s pay and the lack of paid maternity leave in many sectors means that we can ’ t take the time we need after having a child without fear of pushing our families into debt . issues like pay equity or workplace policies often end up sounding like a debate about numbers and legislation , but to black women and our families it is so much more . it is a critical part of ensuring that we can dismantle the systems that work to keep us down .",medium_antiracist

 you are asking us , some of the most sensitive people on racial issues , to "" wake up "" to the exact problem we see every day . racial issues are based on socioeconomic issues , and so instead of talking about race , we talk about the socioeconomic situations that lead to these racial issues , which is the real root of the problem .

medium_antiracist_34624,"that time i witnessed a post trump hate crime if you ’ re following the news you ’ ve probably heard about all the hate crimes and hate speech that has proliferated since trump became our president elect . it turns out that stuff ’ s real . you can add my story to the growing list . on november 7th , i was walking through the subway in new york when i heard someone mutter “ you almost hit me with your box , you fucking n * gger. ” let me repeat this . i was in the subway in new york city . not alabama . not mississippi . not south carolina . not texas . not georgia . and it wasn ’ t 1865 either . it was 2016 . “ seriously ? ” i thought to myself . i turned around . behind me was a middle aged white man in a pinstripe suit and overcoat . before i could even stop to think , i found myself confronting him . “ what ’ d you say ? ” i asked . “ i said he almost hit me with his box ” “ that ’ s not what you said . you said ‘ you almost hit me with your box you fucking n * gger. ’ ” “ yeah , okay . so ? that ’ s what he is. ” “ maybe he did almost hit you with his box but you don ’ t need to use the n-word. ” and with that , our conversation ended . i walked away rattled . he walked away angry , bitter , and muttering to himself . i immediately regretted not saying something more forceful . what i wanted to say was “ fuck you , you human piece of dogshit . bigotry has no place in our society and you represent the worst of america. ” but i didn ’ t say any of this because i was scared . he was a belligerent bully acting erratically . i thought he might take a swing at me or even pull out a gun . so instead of really telling him off like he deserved , i politely just asked this scumbag to be a little less racist the next time around . about ten other people witnessed what happened . one lady went up to the guy who had been discriminated against and asked if he was okay . but other than that , no one said a word . after a very fleeting surge of courage , i ultimately wimped out pretty hard . and everyone else ? well , they just watched . we all failed . and because of this , the bully won . the whole event left me deeply shaken . as i contemplated what i had just witnessed , the only thing that brought me solace was the fact that it was nov 7th . on nov 8th everything would go back to normal and this disgusting cockroach would have to slink back into the dark shadows with all the millions of other closet racists donald trump has emboldened this election cycle . okay . scratch what i said about november 8th . as we watched the election results come in that night and it appeared trump was going to win , i literally couldn ’ t talk . i went numb — catatonic . shock . sadness . disgust . i went to bed before the final results were announced hoping against hope that i ’ d wake up to some miracle . i woke up . i immediately checked my phone . donald trump . president elect . wtf ! ! ? ? ? seriously ? ? we are in deep fucking trouble , america . i can remember being upset when bush won in 2000 and even more so in 2004 because it felt like the dems really blew that one . but this whole trump thing hurt in a way that was on an entirely different level . this was supposed to be the election where hillary won in a landslide and the country sent a loud and emphatic message to the rest of the world that we reject bigotry in all its forms . this was supposed to be the election where america showed the world what values we stand for . in the end , i think we did show the world what we stand for . but sadly we revealed ourselves to be a very different america than the america i thought i knew . to me , electing a racist reality television star over the most qualified nominee we ’ ve ever had is a slap in the face to all women . as a nation we just told women to go back to their place in the kitchen . sit down , woman . you don ’ t belong here . but this election was more than just a slap in the face to women . it was a slap in the face to immigrants to muslims to the disabled and to all minorities . to all these people , america just said “ your lives don ’ t matter. ” it has taken me almost a week to process everything about what just happened to our country . after grieving for a day or so , i spent the next couple days sticking my head in the sand and ignoring all news about the election . i couldn ’ t take it . i was too depressed and angry . i finally started reading the news again on day 3 of the trumpocalypse . but i decided not to write anything until my mind was clear i ’ d really recovered from this state of depression . so now a week has passed and here ’ s what i have to say : i have read about a million articles analyzing the election . i have processed everything there is to process and i ’ ve come to the conclusion that trump voters aren ’ t really racist — they are just regular people like you and me who felt ignored and left behind by an increasingly globalized economy . well that , and they fucking hate mexicans . in all seriousness , i ’ ve read so many articles and blog posts that tell the story of the “ non-racist ” trump voter . these articles explain how it wasn ’ t about white-identity politics . it wasn ’ t about hate . this election was about the economy and jobs . but here ’ s the thing — this storyline complete garbage . seriously , it ’ s fucking offensive . we need to stop normalizing the most abnormal presidency in the last 100 years . of course not every trump voter is a card carrying kkk member . that would be insane and i don ’ t think anyone was ever really claiming that . but if you vote for a racist candidate who promises to take away the rights of minorities simply because you think he ’ ll do a better job on the economy , that is not right — that is not what america stands for . you might not be a “ textbook racist ” but there is an extremely high chance you are someone who just doesn ’ t give a fuck about others . i suppose that is slightly better than being a full-blown racist , but not by a lot . because at the end of the day , whether you hate minorities or not , your intentions are irrelevant . when you choose to prioritize your own economic interests above the basic rights and freedoms of your fellow citizens you are effectively saying “ fuck you muslims . fuck you mexicans . fuck you , women . you don ’ t deserve the same rights i deserve and truthfully , i don ’ t care what terrible things happen to you , as long as i get an extra $ 375 on my tax refund this year. ” that , in my opinion is the biggest problem with america today . it ’ s not that the whole country is racist . it ’ s that the whole country ( both conservatives and liberals alike ) are indifferent to the suffering of people they consider “ other. ” and the whole idea that you can separate bigotry from the trump presidency is nonsense . here ’ s an analogy . i ’ m not sure it ’ s the best one but it ’ s the best i could come up with . racism and sexism are kind of like olives . people who like olives often really love olives . and people who don ’ t like olives don ’ t just mildly dislike them , they find them utterly disgusting . the people who voted trump but claimed they weren ’ t racist are basically arguing that they ordered a veggie pizza and all the things about the pizza were great except the olives . so when the pizza comes out they ’ ll just pick the olives off . but here ’ s the thing . they didn ’ t order a veggie pizza . they ordered olive fucking tapenade ! ! ! when trump comes out on day one of his campaign and says that mexicans are rapists , anyone listening knew that olives were the main course of his campaign . they were baked in and inseparable from the jump . pretending that trump is a veggie pizza is simply offensive . now , i am not writing this post to shame people . i understand that people feel desperate and when you are desperate you make choices you ’ re not always proud of . i don ’ t blame these voters for their choices any more than i blame the guy in the street selling drugs because he sees no other options for employment . but what about the people who were not desperate ? what about those trump voters solidly in the middle or upper class ? . how do they justify their votes ? i want to have compassion for these voters . i want to understand . i want to be openminded . but it ’ s hard . at the end of the day , the bully on the subway might only represent the views of a very small minority of american citizens . let ’ s say 5 % . but when 95 % of the population idly stands by and watches as the bully abuses his victim , we end up in a situation where the bully on the subway somehow ends up becoming the leader of the free world . america , we failed . we didn ’ t stand up for what was right . we chose to be silent in the face of injustice . we chose to vote our pocketbooks at the expense of others . and i ’ m afraid to say , we got what we deserved . i ’ ve come to accept that trump is my president . i really do want to give him a chance . i want to believe that the hateful and divisive things he said during the campaign were just campaign rhetoric that won ’ t become policy . but a week after trump is elected when you hear that trump named steve bannon , an indisputable bigot as his chief strategist , it ’ s hard to hold out hope . so now more than ever , i think it is up to all of us to double down on racial and gender equality . now more than ever it is time to speak up for our mexican and muslim brothers and sisters . now more than ever it is time to fight for justice . we royally screwed up this election because we failed to stand up to the bully . let ’ s not ever do that again . when we see injustice , we owe it to ourselves , to our country , and to the world to speak up .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_31157,"milwaukee — from ashes 2 ashes as of today , at least 730 people living in north america have been murdered by the u.s. police force . many of these people are poor and working class people , disproportionately black and latinx . in the past two years since the ferguson rebellion stemming from a small black colony in ferguson , mo , where 18 year old black michael brown was gunned down by officer darren wilson and left to bleed out in the streets for hours the u.s. has gone through a dramatic change . the amerikan masses , led by oppressed black nation have pushed the national dialogue around “ race relations ” to the point where international attention has been captured . protests in solidarity with the “ black lives matter movement ” or “ movement for black lives ” has shifted the discourse towards understanding the amerikan system as just that a system , one of deep oppression , poverty , degradation , and alienation . so it was no surprise when in milwaukee just a few days ago when another black man , 23 year old sylville smith , was gunned down by the milwaukee police department . the officer who gunned him down turned out to be an old high school friend turned cop , darren brown heaggan . the two attended pulaski high school together . smith ’ s sister recently stated that “ the boy knew my brother personally from high school . they knew each other. ” this goes to show that personality , individuality , and other subjectivisms don ’ t matter when it comes to the issue of police state murder , especially of black people . some reformist minded black folks will continue to harp on about the need for more officers of color so we can have “ equal representation , ” but representation within a neoliberal imperialist killing machine is no true equality , self-determination , or power . heaggan was known in the community by his rap name “ domo ” but also known as a “ snitch , ” “ dirty cop ” and “ uncle ruckus. ” as usual when police commit any kind of heinous crime against the people , officer heaggan was merely put on administrative leave until the police department can figure out their side of the story and present their packaged lie to the public in order to justify this brother ’ s murder . the mainstream media narrative is that smith was armed and was a threat to the police officers , so they had to shoot him dead . the police claim that smith allegedly brandished a stolen handgun and refused to drop the weapon during a foot chase saturday . the officer opened fire and struck smith twice in the arm and chest . but , we have seen multiple accounts where white people , particularly white men have actually pointed and shot their guns at the police and somehow by the grace of colonial white jesus still lived to see the next day and stand trial . however , when it comes to black people , we are a threat simply because we are breathing and are often shot dead whether armed or unarmed . maybe smith understood this simple fact of being a colonized person in the u.s. , that whether one resists or not , one ’ s life is still in danger when dealing with the police state — as his sister says “ if my brother did have his gun in his hand , why he didn ’ t shoot back ? if he is going to out , why not go out with a fight ? why not go out with a big bang ? ” sylville smith was a well known and liked person in his community . after he was murdered by the police , the local community erupted in righteous rebellion . they set fire to gas stations , overturned cars , destroyed the petty private property owned by local parasite capitalists . the next day , sunday august 14th , the national guard was called in to help quell the nascent rebellion but despite that violence erupted again with a 18-year-old man being seriously injured by a gun shot . four police officers were wounded by rocks and bricks thrown by protesters and 14 people detained . when the national guard and police could not effectively put down the growing rebellion , as hundreds of people continued to gather and confront the state in the streets , a curfew ( martial law ) was put into effect forcing young people to get back into their homes by 10 p.m . the targeting of youth was strategic by the police because they know that it is the youth who have the least apprehensions to rebellion and are more inclined to rebel against authority , especially such an illegitimate authority as the police . the short lived burgeoning rebellion was clipped before it could spark an entire uprising . milwaukee police chief ed flynn said on monday night moments before the curfew set in that “ we think we are in , comparatively speaking , a positive place. ” positive place for whom ? the uprising of the black masses may have been short lived but there is no true peace for a colonized people like the black people of milwaukee . what flynn was really saying was that the police state was able to chorale its organized violence and force people back into submission to the racist imperialist status quo , which is no peace at all . peace for the colonizers is hell for the colonized . not just a murder although the corporate establishment and its lackeys will claim that this was a spontaneous act of violence by the oppressed black people of milwaukee revolutionaries know this to be otherwise . milwaukee city alderman khalif rainey called the area a “ powder keg , ” and that “ this community of milwaukee , wisconsin , has become the worst place to live for african-americans in the entire country. ” “ something has to be done to address these issues , ” he added . “ the black people of milwaukee are tired ; they are tired of living under this oppression , this is their life. ” in milwaukee poverty is endemic and on the rise . in the county the median income fell by 10.3 % to $ 43,385 . waukesha county , which had the highest median income in the state at $ 76,319 , saw a 7.1 % drop . washington ( -5.2 % ) , ozaukee ( -7.7 % ) and racine ( -7.9 % ) counties all experienced declining incomes , as well . the capitalist crisis that occurred in 2007–2008 is still felt manifold for the people of milwaukee . the “ great recession ” gutted the state ’ s manufacturing sector and left many unemployed . many of the jobs where a person could earn a “ middle class wage ” disappeared and were replaced by low wage jobs . compounded with this the percentage of people living in poverty increased by 3.9 points to 21.9 % . more than half of the counties in the state saw increases in the portions of people living in poverty . the capitalist economy as it contracts seeks to extract more wealth from the poor , the working class , and strata of the so called middle class . one way this is done is through the drastic raising of rent and keeping wages as low as possible so as to retain as much wealth they can . in milwaukee county , for example , renters spent 32.6 % of their income on rent in 2014 , a 2.1 percentage point increase from 2009 . wages are low , rent increases year by year , and the police routinely get away with abuse and murder . in addition milwaukee is one of the least safest places for young black women , as the fbi found that it is a hotbed of sex trafficking with young women as young as 12 being victimized by sexual exploitation . dana world-patterson , chair of the human trafficking task force of greater milwaukee has said that “ milwaukee has been considered the harvard of pimp school , wisconsin , the hub of human trafficking. ” on top of all this , prisoners have been organizing hunger strikes there against indefinite solitary confinement and illegal torture practices condemned by the united nations and are in violation of their basic constitutional rights . in milwaukee a stunning four out of five black children lives in poverty . also , due to at least two decades of stealing taxpayer money to finance private schools has created the country ’ s most extensive voucher program , essentially robbing the public schools and systematically condemning them to mis-education and human maldevelopment . according to a report by ucla finds that k-12 schools in wisconsin suspend black high school students at a higher rate than anywhere else in the country and has the second-highest disparity in suspension rates between white and black students . the state ’ s biggest city , milwaukee suspends black high school students at a rate nearly double the national average and is the biggest contributor to wisconsin ’ s student achievement gap which is , in turn , the widest in the country . the report can be found here : https : //civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/research/k-12-education/school-discipline/opportunities-suspended-the-devastating-consequences-of-zero-tolerance-and-school-discipline-policies/crp-opportunities-suspended-zero-tolerance-2000.pdf all of this is not merely “ legal ” within the capitalist superstructure , it is absolutely necessary in order to make super-profits off the most oppressed people in the nation , the black nation . the financial strangulation and colonial domination of the black population of milwaukee is no different than what the u.s. government does to oppressed nations like mexico , palestine , yemen , libya , and syria . it systematically destroys a community by organized violence , through sheer force in one hand and with the other financially strangulates the population damning them to be the wretched of the earth . to say that milwaukee was a powder keg is to say the least , it was the apex of racist national oppression and imperialist domination . it makes total ‘ sense ’ that the link in this chain of oppression and exploitation would come to the fore by the self-activity of the oppressed black nation there , by its black working class and chronically unemployed . the black nation here is an imprisoned nation whether they are behind bars or in front of them . the u.s. has a “ corrections ” sector that employs more peple than the combined work forces of general motors , ford , and wal-mart , the three largest corporate employers in the nation . annually this nation spends upwards of $ 200 billion dollars on “ law enforcement ” at all levels of government , aka gestapo police agents trained to assassinate those who are deemed useless to the system , mainly the working class black , indigenous , puerto rican , and xicano nations . so the “ job crisis ” is mainly artificial . there is plenty of work to do , just look at milwaukee and other black ghetto colonies and barrios across the nation . the wealth that has been created by this super-exploitation of oppressed nations belongs to them and it is the capitalist/imperialist system that robs them in more ways than one from excessive ticketing and fining to straight up forced prison labor ! the united states , which has 5 percent of the world ’ s population contains 25 percent of the entire world ’ s incarcerated . this empire ’ s incarceration rate is nearly 40 percent greater than many of the nations our government routinely demonizes ( china , russia , north korea ) . the oppressed nations are crying out for liberation and revolution . only when there is a social revolution can this wealth be taken back and used to heal our communities damaged by racism , sexism , bigotry , ignorance , and capitalist exploitation and extortion . the struggle of the oppressed in front of and behind bars continues and social explosions waiting to turn into social combustions like milwaukee are in need of revolutionary organization , ideology , and leadership . that leadership will come from the oppressed themselves , they have already risked their lives to rebel against all odds , there is certainly no lack of heart or courage . one of the basic laws of society is that where there is oppression there will be resistance . milwaukee was the latest city behind ferguson , baltimore , oakland and others to break and rebel in the streets against national oppression and class exploitation . the fundamental contradiction in the u.s. is still of socialized labor but privatized appropriation of that wealth . however , the primary or principal contradiction , as milwaukee , baltimore , ferguson , and elsewhere has shown us is that national oppression is the powder keg that will spark rebellion and it is the black working class and the oppressed nations within this prison house of nations that have the least to lose and the most to gain from revolutionary upsurges and movements . no amount of violence can extinguish the flames in the hearts of minds of an oppressed nation striving for dignity , justice , and liberation . so although the short lived rebellion in milwaukee was quelled , the resistance is daily and continues in cities and towns all over the nation where oppressed people reside . it is the task of black revolutionaries to organize this ferment , to channel it into a definite political form , able to isolate the enemy of the people , and make strategy and tactics to lead the struggle beyond black capitalism , hotep nationalism , and petite bourgeois radical reformism . we must go deep into the layers of oppressed communities and popularize the need for national liberation through socialist revolution to smash the racist capitalist/imperialist state . the state is already exposing itself as just a instrument for oppression . the black masses are learning through the struggle , on a spontaneous and not scientific socialist basis , but they are inspiring the world over and as sister comrade assata said “ black revolutionaries don ’ t fall from the sky , they are shaped and formed by their oppression. ” new revolutionaries are born with every unchecked injustice against the people . it is our duty to make sure they don ’ t die and that the spark of rebellion becomes a flame that can engulf this empire so we can rebuild ; a truly humane socialist society , with self-determination for oppressed nationalities and miseducation , police state terror , hyper-mass incarceration , sexual exploitation , and poverty wages are a thing of the past — of some ancient barbaric faux-civilization called “ capitalist amerika. ” dare 2 struggle ! dare 2 win ! all power 2 the people ! forward ever ! backward never ! no liberation without socialism ! no socialism without liberation ! .",medium_antiracist

 the bill creates a long overdue legally safe channel with best practice anti - retaliation rights for police or any others who blow the whistle on police illegality . i was / we were frustrated that last year congress was unable to obtain a consensus on greater controls against police abuses . but whistleblower protection can still make a real difference by better enforcing the laws already on the books . after all , murder always has been illegal .

reddit_antiracist_82624,"but it 's * * very common * * ( more than simply "" not strange "" ) for non - white people to see white as "" the most usual "" , especially for those who have grown up and still operate within white - dominated societies and institutions . let 's not ignore the lasting effects of colonialism and the fact that there are severe inequities between racial groups across the globe .",reddit_antiracist
reddit_antiracist_75283,"> racism exists in america , because the hood exists , rather than integrate and live among white people , black people ( not all , but the ones most associated with crime ) prefer to live in black neighborhood . 

 that 's not actually true at all . racism in america exists because of corporate greed attempting to extract wealth from people by selling them an ideal of what it means to be human . blonde hair , blue eyes , light , unblemished skin . most people can not reach this ideal , not even most white people , including most with "" aryan "" looks , because most "" aryan "" looking people do not have purely "" aryan "" genetics . 

 it 's just a fantasy used to create a hierarchical system of wealth that makes all individuals easily discarded and replaceable by other people who would roll their bodies over hot coals to meet the ideal , which would be * literally * impossible for them to satisfy . 

 that 's actually the root of american racism . 

 > if black people want to be treated better , they must ( it is sad , but it is reality ) , they must live among the white people , right in the middle of them . 

 that 's not true . black neighborhoods are separated from white neighborhoods with policies like red lining , which later became sub - prime lending after the community reinvestment act . people do not necessarily ostracize themselves into separate communities . that 's done artificially so that financial institutions and corporations can manufacture differences in markets that can be used to gamble . if the corporations win , they privatize the gains . if they lose , they use the government to socialize the losses . that 's why we have ghettos . that 's what the collapse of 2008 was caused by . banks preying on poor neighborhoods and gambling with depositor money to make extreme profits despite creating poverty . since clinton and the glb act deregulated the banks , investment , consumer , and insurance(i think those are the big 3 types ) were often merged into one and stacked upon one another . since so many types of banks were intertwined , when all the gambling they were performing went bad , * which they were literally designed by the bankers to do * , everything collapsed . the government bailed * them * out with * our * tax money , hitting the poorest people hardest , who were already hit the hardest , since they were the * targets * of predatory banking to begin with . 

 most of the cultural influence white america has outside of technology is a result of using violence to marginalize black people when they revolutionize culture in the form of language , music , communication , or cultural norms on sexuality . the result is that white americans develop and foster a very cheap , superficial rendition of what black people have created , and take it as their own while being openly violent and condescending towards blacks and other poc who have fostered a globally revered culture while in america . that 's why people think rock and jazz are white musical revolutions , and so many white artists can win numerous awards in rap and hip - hop . even european classical instruments have direct roots in north and east africa . 

 > in a country where 76 % of the population is white it is obvious the best stuff will be where this people live . 

 that 's not really true at all . white people have a perfectly fine culture . however , the problem america faces is a deeply rooted fanatical need for white violence . it really has nothing to do with white people themselves , but with what i mentioned before in the form of corporate greed and propaganda . that 's why , if you 're barely paying attention to the michael brown video you can clearly observe that he and his friend both take the time to place back on the counter , in front of the store clerk , the items they were accused of stealing . * but * everyone is absolutely convinced that they stole those items , despite evidence clearly suggesting they 're not at all likely thieves . everyone ignores the fact that the store clerk trying to lock him in the store is a felony called false imprisonment . that does n't matter though , since if you 're black in america and you 're accused of a crime , it does n't matter if you 're guilty . if you 're accused , you are guilty , [ despite evidence clearly displaying otherwise . ] ( 

 that 's why so many black people are in prison . has nothing to do with actual criminality , but a political war of propaganda that 's literally been waged since america 's inception . like i said above , it 's simply fantasy , and beneath the surface , everyone is aware of it . i mean , if you 're american , you 've probably had a conversation some time in your life about what the actual cause of violent crime rates spiking in the 1980s was related to . americans love to pretend that it was black people being violent , but that 's not really the case at all . as time progressed out of the 80s , everyone became more aware that violent crime rates did n't only rise in cities like n.y.c , or los angeles . they rose universally across america , in rural places that had no black population , and even far beyond america , in countries all over the planet . 

 that 's because violent crime had nothing to do with black people at all , and it still has nothing to do with them , either . like i said before , it 's just fantasy . a result of corporations advertising to people that they need to destroy themselves in order to be more like a "" civilized "" human , and less like an "" uncivilized "" or "" savage "" african . what actually took place is that in the 30 's , [ dupont , a former weapons manufacturer with vast stockpiles of lead , decided it was a very good idea to sell americans fuel laced with lead , as an "" anti - knock "" additive that prolonged the lives of 

 ofcourse , leaded fuel is beneficial for machines , physical and social , as it prolonged the lives of cars , and corporations that were witnessing lead bans * in civilized nations all over the planet * , but were able to lobby american government in order to sell it to propertied consumers , who as it turns out , due to corporate person - hood , were also property themselves . but what were the effects on humans ? let 's see : 

 *      irritability 
 *      lack of impulse control 
 *      aggressive behavior  
 *      respiratory illness 
 *      heart disease 
 *      autism 
 *      hallucinations 
 *      bone disease 
 *      loss of developmental skills in children 
 *      fatigue 
 *      high blood pressure 
 *      memory loss 
 *      anemia 

 as a result , crime rates in many countries all over the world that used our fuel , and all across the u.s. skyrocketed . in america it lasted into the 80s , since our problem was compounded by the reality that corporations were advertising to americans that lead was safe for use in paint for families , and toys for children . [ john oliver even did a segment on   and it was literally the most depressing episode of his show i 've seen , evidenced by how little the audience seemed to be laughing compared to his other installments . 

 at one point he even described a family trying to escape lead poisoning as sounding similar to the plot of every horror film ever told , which is pretty much what 's been running through my mind since reading the research about it way back in 2012 . 

 but still , despite that , it 's even worse . turns out that dupont was directly involved with henry aslinger , former head of the fbn that was out of a job due to prohibition ending , and nixon , the most notorious criminal president in american history . dupont used their help to lobby government and ban cannabis because it directly conflicted with their other financial interests in textiles , fuel , and pharmaceuticals . the real reason there 's apparently more violent crime in black neighborhoods is because the laws actually function differently there . since nixon , and most likely even before him under henry aslinger , [ police have been go to any lengths to arrest black people for the most minor , nonsensical   which [ results in criminal records and prevents them from finding any meaningful employment other than * permanent * minimum wage 

 black people end up getting arrested for minor cannabis possession at a rate of 18 - 40x that of whites . the research there only shows per - capita , which is misleading , since the population ratio is 5:1 . 

 this entire situation is actually much worse than people seem to think .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_18934,"business leaders — what to do ? in this moment , a lot of businesses and business leaders are asking what they can and should do to support # blacklivesmatter and the movement to fight racism . i was asked recently to participate in a brainstorming session about what businesses can do beyond posting messages of support . i came away from that session with some greater clarity on the topic , and i shared it with some friends of mine who are business leaders . i thought i ’ d post it more publicly as part of my contribution toward change . and as i do this , i ’ ll say from the outset : i am not black . i do not know what it ’ s like to be black in america . i have an inkling thanks to the time , energy , and emotional labor that my black friends and family have invested in me , but only an inkling . i ’ m not trying to speak for black people here , i ’ m trying to participate in the essential work of white people talking to white people . with all of that said , here are a few specific suggestions . the opposite of racism isn ’ t “ not racist. ” it ’ s anti-racist . there is no neutrality on this issue . neutrality aids the oppressor . you can be racist or anti-racist . you have to pick a side . and picking the side of anti-racism means you have a whole lot of work to do . because , especially for white leaders , when we are not actively engaging in anti-racist work , we are coasting on the benefits of racism . we ’ re either swimming against the current , or floating downstream with it . there is no standing still in the river of racism . the single most important thing that business leaders can do is not contribute to a cause or even create an inclusive company culture . the single most important thing that business leaders can do is to work on themselves as individuals . one of the most important concepts of anti-racism is that nobody is free of the infection of racism . to be anti-racist is to acknowledge our own racism . “ doing the work ” begins with examining our own , internalized racism . we strive to understand the ways we contribute to the white supremacy culture in our country and in our companies and seek to undo the damage we have done and do better in the future . the work begins with this , continues with this , but it doesn ’ t end with this . in fact , the work does not end . period . we will be doing anti-racist work for the rest of our lives . if you commit to being an anti-racist . if you work at becoming an anti-racist leader within your company and the other organizations you are part of , you will likely figure out what needs to be done in any given space at any given moment . the second most important thing you can do is work to create an explicitly anti-racist culture in your company . not diverse . not inclusive . anti-racist . being an eeo is table stakes . having a diversity and inclusion committee is good , but not sufficient . hiring black people and other people of color is also good , but also not sufficient . i sometimes hear hr people and business leaders say , “ we just can ’ t find enough qualified candidates of color. ” it makes me wonder : where are you looking ? how are you recruiting ? are your qualifications truly necessary for success ? are they racially biased ? are your job descriptions written for inclusion ? many companies try to solve for this problem by creating entry-level pipelines . what happens as a result is that black people have access to entry-level roles and see no people who look like them in management or executive roles . the company culture remains dominantly white , and many promising black employees leave as a result . a truly anti-racist company will ensure there are black people and other people of color at all levels , from entry to executive . actually having an anti-racist culture , means that , like individuals , companies must acknowledge and fight their own racism . they ask themselves , “ how do our policies and practices perpetuate racist outcomes ? what do we need to stop doing ? what do we need to do differently ? ” anti-racist companies are constantly examining the ways that they contribute to racism internally within the company and externally with their customers and communities . invest in anti-racist training for the company . build an outside accountability board to give you perspective and keep you honest.commit to weaving anti-racism into your company culture as a bedrock principal . put it in the mission statement . make it explicit , and then do the work to make it true . daily . there is a role for companies to play in supporting anti-racist organizations . but this external involvement can not be done as a replacement for the internal work . and it is important to do this work with humility and intentionality . it ’ s not enough to send a team of employees out to build a house or clean a park on an annual service day . it ’ s important to build ongoing relationships with the community and with organizations that serve oppressed communities in our city . one of the best pieces of advice i read early in my anti-racist journey is that white people should join organizations led by people of color , support them , and not try to lead them . listen . follow . support . that ’ s the best way to engage with organizations doing anti-racist work and working to build racial equity . racism is a white people problem . it ’ s not the job of black people or other people of color to solve it . white people created the racist systems in our country , and white people must end them . as a business leader , especially if you ’ re a white business leader , you carry clout within the white community . use your status and connections to invite and encourage others into the work of anti-racism . use every bit of your privilege to dismantle that privilege , so that all americans can truly be free . so that our country can heal this open , septic wound that has made hollow the promise of our ideals for centuries .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_4494,"a monumental shitshow updated 2/8/17 the kkk is coming to town ! ever found yourself caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ? maybe not so much literally , but , how about stuck on the fence of a divisive situation ? that ’ s where i find myself today . again . my hometown , charlottesville , virginia , is in the midst of an argument that i find in equal parts interesting and illegitimate , relevant and ridiculous . it ’ s mostly playing out on facebook , as the important social issues of our time do , with both sides ravenously posting and commenting and rallying for their respective cause . don ’ t misread that as “ intelligent discourse. ” it ’ s a digital dumpster-fire . background : the city council has voted 3–2 to remove the statue . activists in town , led by vice-mayor , wes bellamy , have called for the removal of the robert e. lee statue and the subsequent renaming of what is currently lee park . the statue , which has been up since 1924 , depicts the confederate general on a horse and is the centerpiece of the local park that , last i checked , was home to a naked woman screaming about the 1 % . this removal is slated to cost ( depending on who you ask ) , anywhere from $ 300k to around $ 700k ( highest number i ’ ve seen at the time of writing this sentence ) . for those of you who slept through high school history , here ’ s a brief lesson on general lee . not the general lee . a virginia native , r.e . lee was a general in the confederate army during the civil war . he invaded the north and got his ass handed to him at gettysburg , but doggedly continued to fight on , got schooled by grant a few times in va , then finally surrendered in april of 1865 . by all accounts , someone more inferior would have significantly reduced the death toll by giving up earlier , but hailed as a “ master tactician , ” lee continued to battle throughout 1864 and early 1865 . he ’ s somewhat of a southern icon . like popeyes . though historically , we should be asking , “ why ? ” lee fought on the wrong side of history and lost , yet we idolize him for it . my father , a white dude ( because that will matter to someone ) , made the point to me that “ who your heroes are says a lot about who you are. ” which , in this particular case , weaves a slightly , possibly unintentionally , bigoted tapestry of my dear charlottesville . the statue is a monolithic ode to the racism of the old south , in the same vein as the confederate flag being “ racist wallpaper. ” if you ’ re already bored , or were just interested in confirming your currently-held point of view , watch this video . many who oppose removing the statue will bring to bear the prevailing philosophy of the times . by all accounts lee was a statesman , not an ideologist . think about it in terms of the secret service . an agent who opposes policy doesn ’ t shirk , ( updated , typically shirk ) , his or her responsibilities to protect the president because responsibility trumps ( ha ) , ideology . similarly , lee was loyal to the state of virginia , and when the troops were transferred to confederate service in 1861 , he stood with his state . now , as the psuedo-progressive society that we occasionally impersonate , the logical retort would be “ well , he didn ’ t have to fight , ” or “ he could have gone to the north when lincoln recruited him , ” yadda , yadda . and in theory , that ’ s true , but that ’ s not how things operated back then , and flies in the face of the pervasive military ethos that duty is more important than your personal agenda . tl/dr : lee fought for south b/c of duty + peer-pressure . ok , so , maybe it ’ s just history ? i ’ m black , i ’ m not particularly offended . there ’ s a weak argument there , until you start to draw a parallel to another historical atrocity . let ’ s use the holocaust . yep , it happened , but all of a sudden i ’ m having a hard time hearing the “ you can ’ t rewrite history , ” chants . can anyone rationalize for me , a statue of , say , joseph goebbels ? further , if one did exist as a holdover from the early 1900s ( because society has in fact evolved ) , i ’ m totally open to a cogent argument for not taking it down ? even if goebbels was merely following orders , and documented as being like “ idk adi , this isn ’ t really a great idea , ” but kept on with the genocide and was complicit in the killing of millions of people , would he be revered by , and his stone monument fought for by , his hometown ? sounds ridiculous , right ? if it doesn ’ t . seek help . alright , so on the foundation of facts , one point for the detractors . take it down — 1 . leave it up — 0 . the only reasonable argument i ’ ve come across thus far is economics . folks are concerned about the amount of money it will cost to remove the statue . and though the numbers are wide-ranging depending on who you ask , let ’ s estimate the total number is mid-six figures . in isolation , that ’ s a decent chunk of change , but the reality is that ’ s a blip of the radar of the charlottesville budget ( the city budget for fy 2016–2017 was about $ 162.02m . for reference , 1 % would be $ 1.6m . $ 500,000 is .3 % ) . some will argue that that money could be better used in other places , like public works , schools , etc . i can stomach that . at least it ’ s born from reason . .25 points to slytherin . take it down — 1 . leave it up — .25 . let ’ s fast-forward to the present . i love a good argument that ’ s based in fact and logic , and is respectfully had among reasonable people . sadly , there ’ s a weird , unwritten rule is today ’ s society that if i don ’ t agree with you i don ’ t like you . if you disagree with that , fuck you . here ’ s my issue . it ’ s rare that people are able to have these dialogues ( especially when race and culture are involved ) , in a way that makes any sense . this is an indictment of both sides . it comes down to the simple fact that people are inherently myopic and have a painfully hard time understanding that just because you ’ re not offended by something doesn ’ t make it not offensive . if you ’ re white , i highly-doubt the statue upsets you . just like certain things that bother transgendered people , and women , and hispanics , and muslims , and tall people , don ’ t offend me . it ’ s our responsibility as functional humans to not diminish what ’ s important to sectors of society that we don ’ t fully understand or have the resources to empathize with . i ’ m not saying we blindly take action , but you ’ re shit-dipped if you think your worldview is the only one that counts and you ’ re unable to see passed your own bias . you know what doesn ’ t help ? using facebook as a megaphone for nonsensical bullshit . record scratch . let me orient myself to make sure i ’ m not misunderstanding . mrs. wood wood ( i sincerely hope that ’ s a coincidence ) , i ’ m sure you ’ re a nice woman woman . but your argument is that because it ’ s history and you have childhood memories of the statue , it should stay up . further , because dr. king , unarguably one of the most important civil rights leaders in american history , didn ’ t live in charlottesville , the name of the performing arts center should be changed ? and sharon , i can ’ t believe i ’ m saying this because kay makes such a strong case case , but i am more disappointed in you . what ’ s the life-lesson to be learned here ? avoid things you feel strongly about ? don ’ t we want to empower our youth to stand for what they believe in ? and “ go another way ” ? i rofl ’ d at the stupidity , honey . it ’ s not a mural she doesn ’ t like the color of . duh . it ’ s a giant , visual representation of the subjugation of an entire race of people . aside from the asinine content of your message , your condescending tone married with you labeling this “ a little thing ” makes you sound not only racially insensitive but , well , dumb . as . fuck . take it down — 4 . leave it up — .25 . a point per baffling and inconsiderate comment . and 1/2 a point for each of kay ’ s woods . the ineptitude of a few ( or a lot ) , of social media users aside , the question remains : is this statue symptomatic of a pervasive social issue ? further , is the protest a real attempt to change the paradigm of society by rewriting the vernacular ? or , is it merely someone looking for a pedestal ? a politician smart enough to capitalize on the fact that our president tacitly endorsed a boatload of racial bullshit and the climate is ripe ? here ’ s a question from the opposition that i ’ m intrigued by , though i ’ m still not totally sure why they ’ re so angry . where does it stop ? do you rename robert e. lee high school in staunton , va ? and lee high school in springfield , va. do you go after thomas jefferson , james madison , so forth and so on ? do you tackle everything that is involuntarily , but still , inherently racist that permeates our society ? maybe . and this is a first step . think about it like this . if your ex was a real douche and abused you , you ’ re not going to hang a mural of them in your living room justified by the fact that though they were terrible , they did some other shit decently well . would you ? but it ’ s history . right ? this is bigger than a statue . it ’ s about equality and opportunity . we as a society have a responsibility to pave a more accepting future for those who proceed us by getting rid of the symbols of slavery and segregation . this isn ’ t whitewashing the past , it is history , after all . it ’ s about how we frame our history and interpret the lives and actions of our forefathers . teach it in schools , discuss it in forums , but don ’ t demonstrably celebrate those on the wrong side . cut the hero-worship . if you do oppose the removal , ask yourself , “ why ? ” is it economic ? i can live with that , but re-run your numbers . if it ’ s not dollars and cents , then have a hard think as to why you ’ re , in 2017 , resolutely promoting the implied celebration of a symbol of unequal rights and oppression . here ’ s what tipped the scales for me ; what ’ s the most compelling argument for both sides ? to me , it ’ s the fact that “ it ’ s history ” versus “ it ’ s a symbol of racial persecution and an idol that represents the most oppressive institution in human history that though it was abolished in 1865 , it ’ s legacies still have teeth in modern society. ” one just reads stronger than the other . oh , and to the kkk . enjoy your first amendment , then fuck right off .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_32669,"the opening of the national museum of african american history and culture and the closing of a wound president barack obama gave a powerful and emotionally stirring speech saturday , september 24 , 2016 , as he proclaimed the opening of the national museum of african american history and culture ( nmaahc ) in washington , d.c . the museum , located on constitution avenue nw between 14th and 15th streets , was the fruit of more than 100 years of planning , debate , and resolve , starting with the establishment by president herbert hoover in 1929 of a special commission to study the creation of what would become the nmaahc , the members of whom included activist mary bethune mcleod . the president was joined on the dais by first lady michelle obama , the direct descendant of southern slaves , president george w. bush , who signed legislation in 2003 that created the mechanism for the $ 540 million museum to be constructed and first lady laura bush , president bill clinton , often referred in jest as america ’ s first black president and congressman john lewis of georgia who carried forward the cause for the nmaahc after the tragic death of texas congressman mickey leland in 1989 who was leading a codel to the ethiopian-sudanese border when fate interceded and stole this bright political star . lewis in his own right could have a wing within the nmaahc for his work as student leader of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and for the many times he was beaten by police in the south during the freedom rides of 1964 and during his participation in the march to selma , al over the pettus bridge . also present on the stage were members of the bonner family , notably 90-year-old matriarch ruth odom bonner . ruth ’ s father , dr. elijah b. odom , was a slave who escaped north from mississippi in a bid for his freedom ( one wonders if he ever crossed paths with harriet tubman , the famed first lady of freedom who risked her life in order to give new life to those enslaved brethren held in bondage during the height of slavery in the 1830s and 40s ) . bonner would go on to graduate from medical school and become a doctor , successful raising a family of eight children ( including a son , vernon odom , who would become a classmate of future civil rights leader dr. martin luther king , jr. while attending morehouse college and have a road in akron , oh named after him ) , many of whom would bear witness to the enormity of saturday ’ s event and the ringing of the bell from the historic first baptist church of williamsburg , va signifying the ringing in of this historic monument to achievement in the face of overwhelming odds . in his speech , obama said , “ this national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are . it helps us better understand the lives , yes , of the president , but also the slave . the industrialist , but also the porter , the keeper of the status quo , but also of the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo ; the teacher or the cook , alongside the statesman . and by knowing this other story , we better understand ourselves and each other. ” these words are not lost in their meaning , particularly to those who argue against the very need for an nmaahc or special recognition based solely on one ’ s race or gender . having been fortunate enough to tour the museum a week in advance of its actual opening along with a good friend , that argument is quick to debunk . the museum ’ s footprint stands in the shadow of the washington monument but was designed architecturally to complement the structure in perfect symmetry . it is a stone ’ s throw from the south lawn of the white house , a building whose own legacy is tied to the histories of the slaves who laid the bricks and mortar of this historic residence for free . the layout and design can be daunting but was designed with a purpose and on purpose . as a visitor , you can quickly become overwhelmed by the images you see and encounter , but you are unable to run from them , from our past , that might shock or disturb you . it is this type of “ in you face ” stark reality that is needed to awaken our collective sensibilities and challenge us to think differently about the past and this country ’ s own inhumanity toward one another . our trials and tribulations , our triumph over tragedy , our anger and anguish is tempered by an ability to reconcile , renew and reinvent ourselves . all of these emotional arcs are on full display in this the newest addition to america ’ s attic . our history is a shared history , principled , profound , and poignant . the diversity of this shared history is uniquely american as no country may boast the rich hues and vibrant tones that paint the events of our heritage and its people . the turning of the tide at bunker hill in charlestown , ma is balanced with the tragedy of the colonial slave auctions in baltimore ; the amistad decision is marred by the carnage at the battles of shiloh creek and antietam during the civil war ; the “ indian wars ” contradict our resolve that all men are created equal but the thirteenth ( end to slavery ) , fourteenth ( equal protection ) , fifteenth ( african american right to vote ) and nineteenth ( women ’ s right to vote ) amendments to the u.s. constitution fulfill a promise of hope that not only women and blacks but all americans can secure the freedoms of liberty and participate in this country ’ s political experience . the museum should not be viewed as the black history museum . even though named the national museum of african american history and culture , it is , at its heart , a celebration of that shared history that binds our experience . slavery is america ’ s original sin . there is no denying this fact or running from that truth , which is the very essence of our existence . imagine the anguish and horror of having a loved one ripped from your arms , taken from the womb of the land that gave them birth , and transported thousands of miles over a brutal , unforgiving ocean only to be bound in chains , whipped , prodded and sold as cattle for the purpose of agrarian commerce . if you could look upon the face of the ones you love the most in this world and feel that pain of loss , you may only slightly come close to understanding the painful legacy of american slavery . it is this pain we must face and pledge to never again allow forces of wealth , influence , and power to divide and conquer us solely on racial , gender-specific , or religious lines in order to simply advance their interests at the expense of our moral foundation . that we have never fully come to terms with this part of our history and , moreover , further victimize its descendants whenever they lift their voices in protest to brutality ( “ black lives matter ” ) , unjust and unfair conditions ( “ segregation ” and “ jim crow ” ) , and the systematic murdering of children ( “ 16th street baptist church bombing in birmingham , al , 1963 ” and “ the lynching of emmett till in money , ms , 1955 ” ) is a further indication of the work still left to ensure that all generations of americans present and future learn these important lessons of the past in order to better guide our decision making process and increase inclusion . the opening of the nmaahc should be celebrated for what it is , a chronicle of the american experience for all americans , not just for some or for those believed to have a particular interest in the museum ’ s story because we all are vested in that story . the museum may not close all wounds but if it can help us begin a healing process and all important , long overdue dialogue , let it begin . for as dr. rev . martin luther king , jr. once said , “ we must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools . ”",medium_antiracist

 seriously , this is what i 'm talking about . that was violence . the only rationalization you have of racism is that it is a disabilty . i get that it 's in an extreme case , but the article talks about varying degrees of racism as if they are extremities of a disability .

 as for the ' drawing parallels ' thing , i 've heard it argued that it unfairly cashes in on the difficulties asians face to only acknowledge them when they 'll serve as a handy visual aid by which to * actually * acknowledge and address the difficulties faced by a different demographic .   i 'm still weighing that argument in my mind , so this is me simply mentioning it rather than feeling inclined or qualified to actually assert that perspective , but there you go . 

 tldr : the tweet was a ridiculous misstep because it failed at the necessary context for the racist statement it quoted to serve as the satire it originally was , but the original satire itself is questionable for wheeling out asians simply to serve as a native analog when asians deserve to be acknowledged for their own issues .",reddit_antiracist

 however , the views of the society of the day was reflected by the views portrayed in the comics themselves , and i do n't need to tell you how fucked society was in the great depression . while i do not believe they were ever intended to be used as ' propaganda ' by their original creators , it is inevitable that fucked up ideologies held subconsciously by the creators would be reflected in the stories . so , by perpetuating the pattern laid out by comics through history and not challenging the structure and beliefs of the comics today , the creators of today could very well be publishing anti - progressive propaganda with or without knowing that 's what it is . 

 i love comic books , superhero comics and shows , pulp comics and all that shit , but like everything else we have to be conscious of the subconscious elements in the media we consume . we have to be conscious of the worldview of the creators behind the media we consume . the reason i love comics is because of the time in my life when i found them , the space they held for me , and how i connected with people over them . for someone who does n't have the same kind of social or emotional connections formed around comics and shit , honestly , i do n't see much appeal . because truth is , you 're right . a lot of the time , they end up just following along with the status quo and glorifying the same bullshit . curvy seductive women , buff badass macho men , super - genius super - rich super - white superheroes .",reddit_antiracist

 yes , there is a chance things could escalate like you said , but there is imo a larger chance that a guy running away with a knife ( or similar situation ) that that person goes on to do nothing . 

 i guess it ’s a way to get an officer to use judgment before pulling the trigger , or differ to non - lethal methods . 

 you ’re right about coverups and stuff , that would have to be addressed . it ’s not perfect , but it ’s just an idea .

 it is so important to have representation from all people in dietetics . i recently read that only 4.8&#37 ; of dietitians are african american - i 'm unsure of other demographic information as the article i read was focused on african american nutrition educators . i would recommend looking for jobs in extension , if you have n't already . every state has extension services through their land grant university -   having a master 's degree and healthcare experience would make you eligible to apply for "" agent "" or "" educator "" positions . nutrition related positions would be likely be for the snap - ed or efnep programs and the rd is not required but a master 's degree is . there are also positions that only require a high school diploma . i think you would likely be overqualified for these positions . 

 let me know if you have any questions . if you 're looking for something outside of community nutrition , i 'm not sure i can help but i may be able to connect you with someone to talk to if you 're interested . i do have two male friends who are rds and i think they 'd be willing to connect with you if you 're interested . one of them works in clinical and the other is community / food systems .",reddit_antiracist

 primary sources : 
 i recommend using music for much of the primary source work involving race through the first 1/2 of the 20th century . check out this book : 



 black boy by richard wright is another great primary source 

 james baldwin 's debate of william f. buckley could have multiple lessons built around it as well : 



 podcasts that would be great for this : 
 -more perfect ( done by the creators of radio lab)- especially look into it for the korematsu case-

reddit_antiracist_89629,"it 'll be hard to do in your situation , but my advice would be to take a deep breath , and recognize you 're not gon na change your step dad , and if you did manage to it would n't save the world . the plight of minorities the world over does n't hinge on his casual racism . 

 try to approach his inappropriate remarks not with righteous indignation , but with a kind hearted jovialism . your already dealing with an imbalanced power dynamic in your relationship , he 's the "" dad "" and your the kid . it could be that his "" step - dadiness "" adds more power structure complications as well . as soon as you say something that comes off the slightest bit adversarial he 's going to put up a wall . the discussion will devolve into you two vying for that power instead of discussing the issue at hand . 

 instead , play into his bigotry a little . a favorite game of mine is to try and one up people with my own ridiculous , nonsensical statements . again this must be non - confrontational , light hearted and hopefully funny . 

 in my case , if my mom ( whom i do n't live with anymore ) starts complaining about illegal immigrants coming into the us and taking all our jobs i 'll respond "" god i know ! and have you heard about the swedes who are immigrating these days ? i hear they come over here , go to our schools , use our tax dollars , take our jobs , then they find a nice county fair , fill up on surstromming ( rotten fish ) , hop on the ferris wheel and spend the whole time ripping huge , nasty farts and stinking up our american ferris wheel seats with their disgusting rotten fish bowel gas ! it 's unbelievable ! ! ! ! ! "" 

 you have to do it with complete conviction , and not sarcastically at all . best case scenario - you step dad starts to look at his own ridiculous beliefs and sees how silly they are . worst case scenario - he gets weirded out and stops dropping his casually racist bombs . 

 most importantly remember that your time under his roof is limited and soon you 'll be out of his house and on your own .

medium_antiracist_44897,"horned headdress guy is not a viking white supremacy ’ s native american thefts amid the chaos of the january 6 , 2021 attack on the u.s. capitol , one individual stood out . bare-chested , tattooed , face painted , wearing a horned headdress , and carrying an american flag dangling from a spear , he quickly became a visual icon of the media ’ s insurrection coverage . he was eventually identified as jacob chansley , a.k.a jake angeli , a.k.a “ yellowstone wolf , ” a.k.a “ the qanon shaman , ” a far-right conspiracy theorist linked to the patriot movement in arizona . chansley ’ s attire inspired widespread fascination as well as confusion . “ i don ’ t know what the hell this is , ” wrote elamin abdelmahmoud of buzzfeed . the most common interpretation was that he was aiming for viking . this was a reasonable guess , considering that an imagined viking past has become an integral part of white supremacist mythology and , as kim kelly of rolling stone has pointed out , chansley ’ s body is etched in old norse symbols that have been co-opted by white supremacists . however , the horned headdress , the focal point of his ensemble , was not viking at all . contrary to popular belief , vikings did not wear horned helmets , and the details of chansley ’ s headwear point to a different source entirely . instead of a metal helmet , his head was crowned in a fur pelt mounted with upward-curving black horns . feathers adorned with beads hung next to the coyote tails on either side of his face . in a 2020 interview given to the arizona republic , chansley explained how his costume drew upon native american traditional ceremonial attire to support his assumed persona as a qanon warrior-shaman . the horns alluded to the bison headdresses traditionally worn by members of various tribes of the great plains and southwest , and the coyote tails invoked the trickster figure of navajo legend . “ if you ever tried messing with the buffalo , you get the horns , ” chansley told the interviewer . chansley ’ s appropriation of first nation ceremonial attire to participate in an insurrection intended to overturn the outcome of the 2021 presidential election is particularly twisted considering that tribal members across the u.s. overwhelmingly voted for biden , and increased voter turnout on navajo and hopi nations is one of the factors that turned arizona blue . the story of how a qanon conspiracy theorist appeared in washington wearing a faux-bison headdress and got mistaken for a viking speaks to the erasure of authentic indigenous culture from mainstream public consciousness and its replacement with white supremacist iconography . we collectively associate vikings with horned headdresses because of the success of german nationalist propaganda . in the nineteenth century , anxiety over a lack of common identity across the decentralized association of states that formed the german confederation inspired a search for historical sources that could form the basis of a new unified culture . german scholars were inspired by roman accounts of ancient , unconquered tribes living east of the rhine , and laid claim to old norse literature from scandinavia . in this spirit , the german composer richard wagner mined medieval icelandic sagas in writing his epic opera cycle , der ring des nibelungen . wagner began sketching the libretto during the revolutions of 1848 and premiered the complete work in 1876 , just five years after the unification of imperial germany . costume designer carl emil doepler clad der ring ’ s pantheon of norse demigods in fur draperies and horned metal helmets , crystallizing the image of the viking in the popular imagination . the opera cycle quickly became a favorite of german nationalists , including adolph hitler . during the third reich , nazi critics extolled its characters as exemplifying the virtues of the german race . der ring ’ s evocative costumes and the opera ’ s enthusiastic nazi reception forged a lasting popular association between vikings , horned helmets , and white supremacy . however , doepler ’ s costumes struck cosima wagner , the composer ’ s wife and an ardent nationalist , as an “ archeologist ’ s fantasy ” that made the singers look like “ indian chiefs. ” with little information regarding the garb of bronze-age norsemen , doepler may have turned to other sources for the details of his design . at the time , germans believed that observing contemporaneous “ primitive ” cultures could give them insight into their own ancient past . as historian frank usbeck has argued , the image of the indigenous american merged with that of the ancient norse tribesman in german nationalist mythology , complete with a set of imagined affinities : nobility , bravery , an aboriginal connection to the land , and the right to defend it against invaders . this constructed mythology eventually crystalized in the nazi ’ s “ blood and soil ” ideology and its horrific implementation . the appropriation of north american indigeneity to support displacement and ethnic cleansing was not entirely a german invention . on december 16 , 1773 , american colonists of english descent , calling themselves the sons of liberty , put on mohawk ceremonial garb , boarded three british east india trading ships , and dumped 342 chests of tea into boston harbor . the boston tea party was just one of many protests in which white colonists assumed first nation identities to oppose the heavy taxation that britain required to pay off its debt from the seven years ’ war . the war had secured the continent for british occupation but had ended with the proclamation of 1763 that prohibited further colonial settlement west of the appalachian mountains . like chansley ’ s carefully-constructed costume , the sons of liberty ’ s choice of riot attire was deeply symbolic . in a 1774 allegorical cartoon entitled “ liberty triumphant : or the downfall of oppression , ” lady liberty stands firmly on the north american continent holding a drawn bow aimed at britain . she wears a flowing roman-style robe paired with a straight-up eagle-feather headdress . a group of figures , described in the caption as “ the sons of liberty represented by the natives of america in their savage garb , ” prepare to back her up . by donning indigenous dress , white colonial figures laid their claim to the continent and transferred imaginary native qualities such as unfettered freedom and noble heroic savagery to themselves . lady liberty donned a native-style headdress again in 1863 for her ascent to the top of the newly-constructed capitol building as “ the statue of freedom. ” in 1855 , sculptor thomas crawford submitted a design in which freedom wore a liberty cap similar to those worn by emancipated slaves in roman times . jefferson davis , the secretary of war and future president of the confederacy rejected the design because the history of the liberty cap “ renders it inappropriate to a people who were born free and should not be enslaved. ” crawford combined classical and native american elements in his revision . freedom ’ s new roman-style military helmet was topped with a crest “ composed of an eagle ’ s head and a bold arrangement of feathers , suggested by the costume of our indian tribes , ” as crawford himself described it . one of the tragic ironies of the freedom statue was that philip reid , an enslaved black metalworker , oversaw its casting in bronze , but crawford ’ s use of a native-style crest to symbolize american freedom embeds a second tragic irony . in the year before the statue assumed her position on top of the capitol dome , congress passed three major pieces of legislation that would devastate first nations , following two hundred and fifty years of nearly constant war , dispossession of ancestral tribal lands , and forced removals by death march directed by the united states government . the pacific railway act , the morril act , and the homestead acts were signed by president lincoln in 1862 and accelerated the ethnic cleansing of the american continent and its resettlement with european immigrants . these acts enabled the extraction of vast wealth from native lands and its redistribution to american universities , corporations , and individuals . crawford ’ s design for a pediment entitled “ the progress of civilization , ” mounted in 1863 over the senate ’ s east entrance , commemorated the spirit of american triumphalism over indigenous peoples . according to montgomery meigs , who directed the project , the pediment represented “ our history of the struggle between civilized man and the savage , between the cultivated and the wild nature. ” a female figure depicting america stands at the apex , flanked on the left by figures allegorizing the industry of the young nation . the right side , shown below , depicts a native family . the husband , wearing an eagle feather war bonnet , cradles his head in despair as a white settler chop down a tree . near the family lies a grave . ideologies of white supremacy require a rejection of facts and their replacement by imagined histories and fabricated mythologies . we are now seeing first hand how these myths are generated in real-time . alongside the myth of the stolen election and the qanon conspiracies , white supremacists continue to appropriate the experience and identities of first nation peoples to construct artificial narratives of persecution and to rationalize racial violence . the harm in any cultural appropriation is not the borrowing , per se , it is the alteration of meaning when symbols are taken out of their original cultural contexts and used for new purposes . americans have yet to undergo a national reckoning with the complex five-hundred-year history of genocide and ethnic cleansing of indigenous peoples . in the absence of genuine history , only the mythology remains .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_78822,"disclaimer : i 'm a white dude . not that it matters , i 've been the victim of persistent social ( as opposed to institutional ) racism growing up in a majority mexican community . 

 you did the right thing . setting boundaries and sticking to them is a condition of self - respect , and making sure they 're reasonable is a condition of respect for others . both of these are valuable positive traits for both yourself and your environment . 

 in this particular case , you were met with a case of stereotyping that crossed a boundary that i believe was reasonable for you to have . your acquaintance 's attempt to assert that his girlfriend 's skin color and/or culture contributes to the "" up and down "" nature of their relationship has no foundation in fact . it 's a negative personal opinion judging a person or group of people based on their race , so it 's racist . 

 as to what you can do about it , i understand your frustration . one would hope that one would n't have to point out the obvious ( in this case , that what your acquaintance said was racist , much less the definition of "" racism "" ) , much less that one would be greeted with dismissive hostility when doing so . 

 the crux of my argument is going to be that * * you can not control what other people do * * . 

 in this particular case , you can point out the fault in their behavior . you can try to reason with them . you can even go so far as to inform others of their behavior . then it 's their turn to react . they choose how they 're going to take the information that you 've given them , and react according to whatever suits their mental processes . in this case , it would appear as though your acquaintance has an issue with taking his own racist ideas seriously in regards to their affects on others . this is his problem , and trying to convince him otherwise seems to have put him in a defensive stance over it . 

 however , what you did was right and noble , insofar as informing somebody of their transgressions is right and noble . hopefully , with time and experience , your acquaintance 's views will change . you know them better than i do though , so you already have a lot more experience as to how they might progress , given their current attitudes and environment .

 as a white , conservative , heterosexual , cis male , i may be an outlier in my exact demograohic , but i can assure you most of the more liberal conservatives i know are fully behind you and everything you are doing to end this injustice , and we are doing everything we can within our party and our political and personal circles to change as many perspectives as possible and begin to end racism among conservatives , and the world . 

 i stand in solidarity with you , and support all of the action you are taking for obtain what you should already have ; the right as equality . 

 i guess the point of this comment is to say that not all of us conservatives are against you and what you are doing - i would say the vast majority of us , the real silent majority , stand behind you and support you . 

 if you have any advice for me and my fellow ally conservatives on what we can say to help us convince those conservatives who do not see as clearly ( either intentionally or unintentionally ) as us , i would be very greatful and would use it to continue the internal fight within our parties and help to shuffle this long - awaited change to the top of government .

medium_antiracist_14875,"the calling cards of conjure : buried objects in west tennessee hoodoo history the fear of buried magical objects can be observed throughout the history of hoodoo culture in western tennessee . as early as 1881 reports of buried or obscured objects appear to have had an effect on people who believed themselves to be targets of magical workings . in 1881 memphian sarah white believed that a cloth bag containing hair and lodestone discovered in the fold of her bed mattress was placed there to cause her harm . the woman soon grew gravely ill and believed that the bag was affecting her health . the mysterious bag was eventually taken by white and a local rootworker to the bank of the mississippi river where it was thrown into the river to be destroyed . west tennessee hoodoo history is filled with accounts of mysterious bundles being left on people ’ s property . and in many of the recorded accounts the owner of the property demonstrates a certain amount of anxiety upon their realization of what the object represents . a 1903 states graphic newspaper out of brownsville tennessee some 35 miles outside of memphis reported an incident where a curios object was discovered leading to suspicions of hoodoo practices . the article reads “ julius jackson , a negro living out beyond the graveyard was greatly wrought up tuesday on discovering something inside his well of water . investigation proved the find to be a small bundle containing pods of red peppers , dog ’ s hair and a rabbit ’ s foot . the negro is convinced that a hoodoo negro is after him ” . where did this fear of buried objects come from ? why were these rather ‘ mundane ’ looking objects the source of stress and anxiety for many west tennesseans ? the secret lies in the practice of southern african-american conjure and even deeper in traditional african culture . the role of the rootworker in the rural south was very important to many african-americans who sought out treatment for physical ailments . the herbal knowledge maintained by these specialists would help many families maintain health many times in situations where there was little to no healthcare available . the role of the conjurer was something different . conjurers in the south had a great reputation for using various forms of sorcery . naomi mcpherson in her article ‘ a question of morality : sorcery and concepts of deviance among the kabana , west new britain ’ defines sorcery as ‘ a form of esoteric knowledge bestowing personal power which the adept can use willfully to realize desired ends ’ . throughout the delta , conjurers were recognized for their ability to utilize esoteric knowledge for themselves and clients . the conjurer would have the ability to resolve social stresses through various forms of spiritual therapy . those perceived as enemies and oppressors could be combated magically through the art of the conjurer . in some cases the conjurer would operate as a spiritual mercenary of sorts with clients paying for their services as a spiritual aggressor toward their enemies . these services in many cases involved using material components such as charms in the form of medicine bundles used in ‘ crossings ’ . these bundles would contain ingredients that emitted a form of magical energy that combined with the creator ’ s intent could cause harm or manipulate situations . some of these bundles would be hidden in the presence of their enemy in order to be effective . the belief being that by merely being in the presence of the bundle that the energy from the bag would affect the target . this form of contagious magic is one of the many hallmarks found in african derived traditions . a number of african traditional religions have utilized these same practices for centuries . in fact in many cultures the objects that are constructed and hidden may serve as ‘ calling cards ’ of the ritual specialist . this can be seen cross-culturally among the lolo people of papa new guinea . the objects are said to announce the presence of a ritual specialist as they are discreetly hidden but are made to be discovered . as marty zelenietz describes in his article one step too far : sorcery and social change in kilengue , west new britain “ in the dark hours , they steal into a village to plant sorcererized materials under a man ’ s house , ladder or bed ’ . the practice of hidden objects as curses was observed by sir e.e . evans-pritchard in his work among the azande of southern sudan in the 1920 ’ s . the azande utilized a form of medicine known as ‘ menzere ’ which pritchard believed might be derived from an abnormal parasite . he describes the procedure that the ritual specialist utilizes as follows : ‘ the sorcerer goes by night , generally at a full moon , to the homestead of his victim and places the medicine on his threshold in the centre of his homestead or in the path leading to it. ’ and later ‘ menzere is so potent a medicine that should any man for whom it is not intended step over it he will be ill for a while though he will not die. ” another example of this ‘ hiding medicine ’ can be seen among the igbo people of nigeria in ‘ ochuchu ’ in which misfortune or affliction may occur through magical means either by air or by buried concoctions in the ground . all that was needed was for the victim to either touch or walk over the hidden object . this was believed to be enough to magically attach the energy to the victim . considering that african-american southern hoodoo was born from the root of african healing and spiritual traditions , it is apparent that many of the same stresses regarding buried magical objects continued as well . remnants of a surviving culture…",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_19685,"why it ’ s time to recognize my privilege and work to level the field by david lynn , co-founder and ceo of mission driven finance , an impact investment firm and certified b corporation how many times have you heard a white friend ask this recently : “ i ’ m not racist , but what else can i do ? ” my honest answer : a lot . what we ’ ve been doing for over 50 years ain ’ t cutting it . the best anti-racism advice i ’ ve gotten so far is from my teammate louise jordan : in 50 years , we ’ ve collectively failed to close the racial wealth gap . we ’ ve failed to close the education achievement gap . we ’ ve failed to close the health gap . unfortunately , many of the actions we white people take end up reinforcing existing power dynamics and telling the same , false story — that black people and people of color have inherent risk and problems and that white people must “ save ” them from themselves . as a white man , i can , should and will listen to my black , indigenous , and people of color colleagues and neighbors . but listening alone is not enough . dangerous “ race-neutral ” policies aren ’ t the answer . we need to recognize our own privilege and get to work leveling the field . in acknowledging my own white privilege , i share my personal journey as a white male : over time , it became more and more apparent to me that if we want to accelerate social change , philanthropy is not enough . government capital is not enough . we need to find ways to harness the gargantuan amounts of private capital to invest in community . so in 2016 , lauren grattan and i started mission driven finance with the sole intent of moving capital to where it normally doesn ’ t flow but should . i was able to co-found mission driven finance due to privilege . owning a house in southern california and access to personal networks of other privileged people gave us the initial capital to give our certified b corporation a shot . we could take the risk because it is highly unlikely we or our families will end up homeless or without food on the table . i ’ ll acknowledge as well that i probably could have started an investment firm without my co-founder lauren , a mixed-race woman of color , though it wouldn ’ t have grown the way it has . with her leading our company culture in a way i couldn ’ t , along with immediately adding more people with intentionally diverse viewpoints to our investment committee , we have created a strength we wouldn ’ t have otherwise . but the diversity we know to be a strength has not been met without struggles as a “ not-normal-looking ” financial firm ( where normal = pale , male , and stale ) . i ’ ve seen firsthand how many middle-aged white men assume lauren is my secretary or that she isn ’ t critical to the conversation or the success of our investments . you could say i was in the right places at the right times , but i recognize that i could access those places in large part because of where i grew up ; because of the boost of my father ’ s career and family connections ; because of my early exposure to and resulting comfort with markets and commercial finance ; and because my face is the kind that employers , bankers , and other partners expected . that recognition of what privilege has afforded me is step one . step two is actively working to “ spend down my privilege ” ( with credit to brittany packnett cunningham ) . so that ’ s what i , a white male ceo , am committing to doing : embrace louise ’ s challenge to change the narrative and actively encourage the redistribution of power . as a company built to be a deliberately developmental organization , mission driven finance is committed to continuously uncovering our own blind spots as individuals , as investors , and as a team , and developing ways to get better . this applies to finding innovative ways to raise and deploy capital , as well as identifying how we might be perpetuating inequitable practices in finance—many forms of which are rooted in racism . we know that the norm isn ’ t working . the only way we will gut the narrative of the current financial system is if we actively , intentionally reject the norm . from mission driven finance ’ s first day as a commercial lender , we pledged to never seek personal credit scores , personal guarantees , personal tax returns , personal background checks , or personal collateral . this is a regular point of contention with investors and partners who are used to protecting against perceived risk—but it ’ s not up for discussion . this year , we launched the community finance fellowship , to begin to change the face of finance to reflect the diversity of our communities . five intrepid souls joined our team as full-time paid employees this march , just as the pandemic was unfolding . we couldn ’ t predict the future , but we knew we would need people on our team who could help us understand how to connect with black , indigenous , and other communities of color . during the covid-19 pandemic , reaching these communities is more critical than ever as the system once again failed them . we didn ’ t start the fellowship to teach . we started it to learn . i can not and should not design the solutions for black , indigenous , and people of color ( bipoc ) . my role is to build an organization that co-creates with bipoc partners the structures that let capital — and power — flow . a few weeks ago , tiffani ashley bell summarized the simple call to action for anti-racist investors : “ make the hire , send the wire. ” we ’ re doing fairly well on the hiring . as of this writing , our team is 61 % people of color and 67 % women , for a total of 83 % non-white-male . this diversity is reflected in our leadership , our investment committee , and our staff . but we have work to do on the wiring . even with our intentional approach , our core fund advance has only sent 36 % of our capital to organizations owned or led by people of color . while we ’ ve done some things well , we ’ ve also been too passive in confronting this discrepancy . no more excuses . we must invest in the narrative we want and get to a majority-bipoc portfolio . that ’ s the minimum threshold we can consider success in the san diego region . recognizing that there is much more we can do to be actively anti-racist , we are publicly making these commitments . we will : we ’ re committed to investing in more bipoc borrowers ; to advancing inclusive hiring , compensation , and growth ; to finding retirement plan options that don ’ t counteract racial justice ; to using our relatively small discretionary budget to reinforce our values by buying from bipoc vendors and women , our portfolio companies , b corps , and small local businesses . every person on our team has the authority to spend time in the community to listen and to source dealflow . but that often feels abstract , and abstract is rarely accountable . instead of resting on our open-door referrals , we are exploring how , especially in a pandemic , we can show up and build more trusting ties with black communities and other communities of color . our overarching mission is to reconnect capital with community and empower communities of color to use finance as a tool for change . we will increase our allocation and offers of time to develop the trust and relationships that build an engaged pipeline of potential borrowers . our marketing and communications team will uplift overlooked and underestimated bipoc perspectives . and all of us will show up with a renewed sense of equity and welcoming , taking on much of the labor of following up , scheduling , and maintaining momentum . our team is intentionally diverse because we firmly believe we are stronger together , we make better decisions , and we better reflect and connect with our community . but we may not always hear all voices . we commit to interrogating our internal practices—including meeting formats , agendas , and facilitation norms—so that all voices are comfortable contributing and are heard . we will use any influence we have in our own circles to advance anti-racist decisions . we can push from a place of power and privilege and point out inequities in investor spaces , and won ’ t just brush off the “ drunk uncle ” statements . we will challenge our banking partners and investees to identify and eliminate systems that have perpetuated discriminatory or inequitable outcomes . we will continue to have difficult and uncomfortable conversations with each other , colleagues , friends , and families , to educate ourselves on anti-racism and push on others to do the same . anti-racism is a daily practice , not a destination . as a deliberately developmental organization , the biggest commitment we make is to channel maya angelou , and “ do the best you can until you know better . then , when you know better , do better. ” b lab ’ s inclusive economy challenge gave us a fantastic list to work on , and we ’ ve signed on to the racial justice investing statement and call to action , but we welcome more suggestions to keep doing better . in the coming weeks , lauren and i will work with our team to co-design measurable actions to hold ourselves accountable to these broad commitments . for me and for mission driven finance , the answer is simple : when our investors come from the same communities we strive to support , then we will have redistributed power and changed the narrative . until then , we haven ’ t done enough . a version of this article was originally published by mission driven finance . b the change gathers and shares the voices from within the movement of people using business as a force for good and the community of certified b corporations . the opinions expressed do not necessarily reflect those of the nonprofit b lab .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_75823,"i have to disagree with you and this may be due to my misunderstanding of racism .   but a generalization about a group of people based on nothing but skin colour that beholds negative connotations ( such as in this example ) is pretty much the definition of racism .   actually , let me verify this for myself !  

 "" the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics , abilities , or qualities specific to that race , especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races . 
 "" theories of racism "" 
 prejudice , discrimination , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior . "" 

 ok by that definition , i still maintain that the subject is racist .   the implication of the subject is that white people in particular have a skewed idea of what racism is .   that is racist , plain and simple . 

 if it has said "" studies suggest that the highly autistic are less able to distinguish between racist and non racist sentiments "" or "" people who like to eat red meat have a skewed perception of racism "" then it would not be racist .   but by asserting the claim "" white people "" , you are then entering the realms of racism and/or racial discrimination .

medium_antiracist_38793,"on ‘ underground ’ and the centuries-old fight for reproductive justice the historical drama underground centers the complexities of womanhood and motherhood for enslaved women . it ’ s through a reproductive justice lens that primetime viewers see the lives of characters such as mother/daughter duo ernestine ( amirah vann ) and rosalee ( jurnee smollett-bell ) unfold in the antebellum era . now in its second season , the wgn america original show tracks what ’ s left of the macon 7 , a group of enslaved women , men , and children . the macon 7 fled a georgia plantation and headed north in search of freedom in an exit so fiery that the cotton fields were literally left ablaze . the series is important for several reasons , not least of all because it demonstrates how history is connected to the present ; black women are still fighting for reproductive autonomy , with reproductive oppression being at the core . the desire to control whole communities of people through the regulation of their bodies , labor , sexuality , and reproduction was a sinister strategy in 1857 , the year underground is set . and yet such tactics remain in place in 2017 . to have pop culture elevating this conversation to mainstream audiences is key to living in a world where everyone is free . it also is key to experiencing true reproductive justice as outlined by sistersong women of color reproductive justice collective : the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy , have children , not have children , and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities . created by joe pokaski and misha green , underground digs deep into the reproductive horrors black women faced under chattel slavery . slavery was a savage institution . black people — enslaved or free during this period ( see solomon northup ’ s story in the book 12 years a slave , upon which the film is based ) — lived in a constant state of fear . plantation life meant negotiating day-to-day survival with hyperfragility as not to upset the intricate maze of authority : owners , overseers ( white and black ) , and basically any white person — adult or child . the slightest misstep could mean being lashed bloody or receiving any cruelty the punisher could dole out . and yes , death . yet , women in bondage experienced a particular terror . not only were these women valuable for the manual labor they produced , but slaveholders sought to exploit and control their reproductive capabilities too . enslaved women were forced to give birth not to babies to be loved and welcomed as additions to their families , but as a source of free labor for slaveholders . this perversity was designed to strip away the humanity of black women ’ s childbearing , reducing it to breeding for the master ’ s financial gain . underground tells the story of how enslaved women made complicated decisions around motherhood , from taking measures to control their fertility to ending unwanted pregnancies , and the lengths they went to protect their children . that could mean committing an act of desperation such as drowning your newborn to prevent the child from living in slavery . seraphina ( devyn a. tyler ) , an enslaved woman , does just this in the very first episode of underground . and toni morrison ’ s novel beloved is based on the arguably most well-documented case of infanticide in u.s. history , margaret garner ’ s story . it also could mean an enslaved woman exerting agency over her reproductive life , like ernestine , who as a young girl committed to learning midwifery and medicine to arm herself with the know-how to decide if and when to have a baby . ernestine pulled babies , helped women have abortions , and even sterilized herself to prevent further pregnancy . and she passed this wisdom down to her daughter . and for enslaved women to have healthy pregnancies and even care for their children under such harrowing conditions , that could mean any number of risks . it ’ s an expectant rosalee , on the lam , envisioning a free world for her and her loved ones by risking her life as “ black rose , ” a guide on the underground railroad . it ’ s her wrapping her belly on these treacherous assignments , foraging for food , triaging her own bullet wound and snake bite , and even killing for her freedom and to protect the life of her unborn child . it is pearly mae ( adina porter ) , an enslaved mother , sacrificing her life so her husband and daughter can run away . while underground is historical fiction , don ’ t think for a second that real-life enslaved women didn ’ t endure these things and worse . slavery is the grisliest true story there is . bondage and all of its brutalities were real-life atrocities for generations of black bodies in this country . and if that ’ s not enough , underground is adding in storylines on intimate partner violence , substance abuse , and suicide . underground also is a history lesson on radical black feminism and womanism set to a contemporary soundtrack of the likes of beyoncé , alice smith , and executive producer john legend , who created the song “ in america , ” just for the occasion . this season introduces the legendary harriet tubman as a recurring character . having harriet tubman ’ s story told on tv in all of its fierceness is the stuff black girl dreams are made of . we need images of her to teach the world that black women of this period were resisting slavery using guns and military strategy , and leading life-threatening rescue missions too . the sewing circle that white abolitionist elizabeth ( jessica de gouw ) joins is a front for interracial anti-slavery organizing and a gun club of sorts . a nod to sojourner truth ’ s renowned “ ain ’ t i a woman ? ” speech was given as an enslaved man , daniel ( bokeem woodbine ) who is secretly learning to read , read some of it to his young daughter . with some of the lushest storytelling and strongest writing around , each episode leaves you gasping for air with little recovery time in between scenes . jurnee smollett-bell ’ s acting chops are full-grown here as she delivers career-best acting as rosalee ; she nails scenes with little to no dialogue , where raw talent is required and silence is her antagonist . amirah vann ’ s performance as ernestine will leave you spellbound as a woman in inner turmoil haunted by regret . read the rest on rewire here .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_36233,"a seat at the table : the southern black creative ’ s struggle to create value in white spaces 2016 , my 27th year of living , was the most transformative one to date . and the fact that i keep saying this after each year speaks to how intense operating in purpose can be as we age . more specifically , as a black man & creative living in the south-first alabama for 10 years and now tennessee , that purpose and the works it creates are rooted in my varying experiences within the african diaspora . both parts african and american , the duality of my south-side atlanta upbringing & cameroonian experience creates a need in me to build communities that mirror who i am , in its totality . the reality is that for many millennials in southern states , especially mid-sized southern cities like chattanooga , tn & huntsville , al , the opportunities to create and add value to traditional systems just aren ’ t as plentiful as they should be . as i look at my friends and peers , many who have excelled and graduated from southern institutions , mainly hbcu ’ s , there is a similar conversation had by us all . and that is , where in our southern america , can we live where our individuality is respected , value is identified and work is compensated adequately ? to answer this question accurately is to take an intense , critical look at the cities we call home and the systems that hold them together . because when you look at the numbers , black millennials hold the answers to many of our society ’ s questions . don ’ t believe me ? ask nielsen . they just released a consumer report entitled “ young , connected & black : african-american millennials are driving social change & leading digital advancement ” that stems from a dialogue begun in the 2015 diverse intelligence series report — “ increasingly affluent , educated and diverse , african american consumers : the untold story. ” the opening line of the report states : “ african-americans are exuberant and reflective — optimistic about present-day advances in income , education , entrepreneurship and health care , and determined to forge a better future as influential leaders and catalysts of social awareness against discrimination and social injustice. ” the report continues to express and explore the various ways black millennials are increasing our buying power , investing in brands that speak to black love and pride , leveraging our understanding of technology and social media , investing in holistic living and urban sustainability and being the change we wish to see in our america , the one our children will have to live in . so with consumer data that reflects why black millennials seem to be * cough * ( dope as hell ) the best return on investment for companies across industries , why do our cities not invest in our influence , expertise and buying power ? too much like right ? this lack of representation in spaces of leadership & decision making across southern communities is rooted in a culture that indulges in black creativity but turns a side-eye to black enterprise . one that places an emphasis on the preservation of “ the good old days ” , not realizing how bad those days were for everyone else . per our friends at wikipedia , innovation is defined as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements , unarticulated needs or existing market needs . so as innovation districts and startup communities across the country become the catalyst for increasing urban development and local economic infrastructure , the need for black millennial wins in our southern america is a must . because…innovation . simply put , we need to see more of our tangible heroes . educators . doctors . lawyers . app developers . restaurant owners . yoga instructors . authors . artists . musicians . black creatives & entrepreneurs who create sustainable businesses that strengthen community infrastructure . we have all of these people here , in our south . the issue , however , isn ’ t in numbers , but in representation . because if you visit our downtowns and “ central business districts ” , places where various cultures traditionally collide and intersect , you don ’ t see us in positions of leadership , ownership . and that ’ s a shame . because black millennials are killing it right now . and until our southern , black millennial experiences and flavor become a part of the aesthetic of the many places we call home , cities like atlanta and miami will continue to bust at the seams . and i love my hometown , but 285 can ’ t take no more . furthermore , the black southern experience is one rooted in family values , social equity , and black empowerment . black colleges & universities present unique , structural & cultural challenges yet instill a sense of pride , preparedness , and perseverance in students that rival few . our graduates and young professionals are blazing trails in technology , education , entertainment , social justice and entrepreneurship and coming up with new-age solutions to age-old problems in our communities . being an urban planner , counselor and thought leader , my ability to communicate and influence across barriers has seen me permeate these traditional spaces while still maintaining my cultural identity . but this has not come without a steep price . one that gives me a great story to tell , but not an experience i would wish on any graduating college senior looking to put their skills to use in a community they love and are invested in . so as the push towards building communities that represent us grows , our southern cities will continue to feel the pressure of a growing , and thriving , black professional population . one that places a value on their local community while embracing and celebrating the various cultures of the diaspora , in that community . simple enough , right ? with all of this said , it ’ s up to us as change makers to continue pushing the envelope and achieving greatness right where we are . the more we win , the easier these conversations get . so let ’ s keep winning . at this point , we will forever and always have a seat at the table . but the issue is no longer whether we are at the table , but rather how many of us are there and do we own it yet . follow me online on instagram , twitter , facebook : @ afuokosun . # blkcreatives",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_14226,"on mlk day , recalling the long history of jewish-black solidarity every january , communities around the nation celebrate the legacy of rev . dr. martin luther king , jr. , that great american prophet of equality . but this year , mlk day coincides auspiciously with the yahrzeit ( anniversary of death ) of another influential prophetic voice , that of rabbi dr. abraham joshua heschel . the two religious and moral leaders developed a friendship built on mutual admiration and solidarity that would come to symbolize the joint black-jewish struggle for civil rights and equality , one that extends back to at least the 19th century . compelled by our own experiences as targets of discrimination and our tradition ’ s teaching that such experiences should move us secure justice for the maltreated and marginalized , the jewish community played an outsized role in the civil rights movement. “ the success of the civil rights movement in raising the consciousness of america , ” noted civil rights icon dr. clarence jones , former advisor and personal counsel to dr. king , “ was made possible by the coalition we had with the american jewish community. ” as many as one-third of the freedom riders who travelled to the south during freedom summer were jewish , as were an estimated 90 percent of civil rights lawyers working in the south during that period . jews figured prominently among the founders of civil rights groups like the naacp , the leadership conference on civil rights and human rights , and other important groups . and when dr. king was falsely accused of tax-evasion , two-thirds of the money raised for his legal defense fund came from jews . but while the outsized contribution of jewish-americans to the advancement of civil rights is well known , much less known is the broader history of solidarity between jews and african americans in the struggle for equality , which extends back more than half a century before the civil rights era . in the late 1800s , the tsarist regime enacted new discriminatory laws that barred jews from numerous professions , limited jewish land ownership , restricted where jews could live and other bigoted measures . worse , a wave of pogroms ( anti-jewish mob violence ) , often encouraged , sanctioned or ignored by the authorities , swept across eastern europe devastating jewish communities in their wake . the parallel to the treatment of blacks in the south did not go unnoticed . african american periodicals ran articles illuminating the plight of jews in russia , condemning the russian regime as “ the worst form of despotism the world has ever seen. ” though it may seem beyond belief , wrote timothy thomas fortune , a prominent african american journalist who had been born into slavery , the jewish subjects of the tsar are “ treated worse than our people in the south have ever been. ” african americans took action . black churches took up collections , raising considerable funds for jewish relief efforts . they organized rallies on behalf of russian jewry and african american leaders , such as booker t. washington , spoke out passionately about the mistreatment of their brothers across the sea . african american lawyers drafted resolutions calling on the tsar to rescind the discriminatory laws and urged the u.s. government to “ offer asylum to these people ” if the regime did not act to halt the “ indignities and barbarities practiced on the jews. ” demonstrating uncommon knowledge of jewish law , african american ministers spoke out against the blood libel that served as the pretext for attacks against jews . “ the blood offered up by the jews…at the feast of passover is the blood of an animal that has been cleansed and purified according to jewish ceremonies , ” explained the washington colored american , “ the blood of a christian child could never answer for that purpose. ” nearly a century later , the jews of russia , now subjects of the soviet regime , still suffered discrimination and persecution , despite the equality promised by communism . soviet jews faced quotas at educational institutions , constraints on employment , and restrictions on jewish worship and cultural observance . studying hebrew or expressing zionist sentiments was considered subversive activity and could earn one a stay in a siberian gulag ( work camp ) . as before , african americans joined the struggle to address the plight of their “ jewish brothers across the sea. ” prominent leaders of the civil rights era who had fought alongside their jewish allies for the rights of african americans in the united states , bonded together in solidarity once again under the banner of the soviet jewry movement . dr. king , who , along with other u.s. leaders formed the conference on the status of soviet jews , appealed to the conscience of the world on behalf of soviet jews : “ i can not stand idly by , even though i live in the united states and even though i happen to be an american negro , and not be concerned about what happens to my brothers and sisters who happen to be jews in soviet russia . for what happens to them happens to me and to you , and we must be concerned… ” the struggle of the negro people for freedom , ” wrote king , “ is inextricably interwoven with the universal struggle of all peoples to be free from discrimination and oppression . … in the name of humanity i urge that the soviet government end all the discriminatory measures against its jewish community. ” black civil rights icon bayard rustin , became a leading voice advocating for aliyah — immigration to israel — for soviet jews who were then barred from leaving the soviet union . rustin worked diligently with senator henry jackson to pass landmark legislation that tied u.s. trade relations with the soviet union to its treatment of jews . the jackson-vannick amendment put human rights , for the first time , at the center of international and trade relations . born in the soviet union under the circumstance enumerated above , i write to you today as a beneficiary of that coalition between jews and african americans . having faced the reality of second class citizenship in the place of my birth , fleeing as a refugee , and growing up as an immigrant religious minority , i , like so many jews and african americans who came before me , felt compelled into common cause to secure the rights of all those who are mistreated and marginalized . in the famous words of emma lazarus , whose immortal verse graces the statue of liberty , as evidenced by recent events , there remains much work yet to be done to achieve true racial equality . sixty years after brown v. board of education promised equality in education , black and latino students are three times as likely to attend schools where fewer than 60 % of teachers are licensed and certified by the state as their white peers and where advanced science and math classes are severely lacking . students of color are also three times as likely to be suspended or expelled from school ( correlated with incarceration later in life ) as white students , despite no difference in behavior . resumes with african-american-sounding names are 50 % less likely to garner an interview . and african americans are disproportionately targeted by the criminal justice system with higher frequencies of arrest and harsher sentences than whites for the same crimes . and , for their part , jews remain among the most likely to be targeted for a hate crime . as we reflect on the legacy of dr. martin luther king jr. and recall the long history of jewish-african american solidarity in the struggle for equality , it is incumbent on us to , as dr. jones is fond of saying , “ take the baton of that glorious , noble and moral coalition ” and rededicate ourselves to working in solidarity with one another in that struggle . now , more than ever . “ the success of the civil rights movement in raising the consciousness of america , ” noted civil rights icon dr. clarence jones , former advisor and personal counsel to dr. king , “ was made possible by the coalition we had with the american jewish community. ” “ i can not stand idly by , even though i live in the united states and even though i happen to be an american negro , and not be concerned about what happens to my brothers and sisters who happen to be jews in soviet russia . for what happens to them happens to me and to you , and we must be concerned… “ until all of us are free , none of us are free . ”",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_54517,"i 'd like to address both of your points :  


 op : the thing is , the systems we 're fighting against control our entire government . those same systems are used , again and again , to propagate white supremacy globally . removing the political leaders who support these oppressive tactics and replacing them with leaders who are actually interested in justice means that we can then expand this movement beyond our own borders . the people in power now do n't care , because as long as black and brown people are fighting themselves and each other , they are n't a threat . we do care , and not just about people in our own country but globally too . if we had dismantled this systemic oppression decades ago , we could have intervened in the atrocity you 're referencing , but , to use something of a proverb , we ca n't lend you a tool if our own house is too messy to find it .  


  
 commentor : the thing is , its not about the numbers . it 's about the intent . george floyd was killed for absolutely no reason , other than complete disregard for his welfare . there was a trained emt literally screaming at chauvin to check george 's vitals , because he was visibly in medical distress . his medical distress was ignored because he was black . i saw it put fairly eloquently the other day : no black person ever killed another black person for being black . and that is what we 're fighting against . to stop black people from being killed simply for being black .   and that false dichotomy , comparing intent against numbers , is why you 'd be called racist . additionally , i 'd like to point you at an old fbi program called cointelpro . it was established by president hoover , and it existed specifically to run psyops to sway public opinion against people of color , and to disrupt the civil rights movement in anyway necessary , including attempting to blackmail martin luther king jr , and outright murdering fred hampton . it was so successful that your comment is based in messages they put out . "" this does n't matter because they 're killing each other "" should never be a reason for any american citizen to be denied the right to life , the same way prior criminal history should never be a reason to strip an american citizen of his or her constitutionally assured right to a fair trial by a jury of their peers . some people looting and rioting should n't detract from the movement as a whole that is only seeking to be treated like human beings . yet , cointelpro laid the framework for white and white passing citizens to use these justifications against people of color . i 'm not interested in attacking you , i 'm solely hoping to help you see the reasons behind our actions , and your own actions . i hope you can find it in you to research things like cointelpro and its effectiveness in today 's world , and redline districts ,  
  and how those practices made way for gentrification to dismantle black communities and disrupt black harmony , and hundreds of other past examples and how they reach into the here and now .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_39854,"what is jewish supremacy and how is it different from white supremacy ? there are more similarities than differences between jewish supremacy and white supremacy . both are based on ethnic/nationalist bias and racism . they are both “ historically based , institutionally perpetuated system [ s ] of exploitation and oppression … a web of interlocking , reinforcing institutions : economic , military , legal , educational , religious , and cultural . as a system , racism affects every aspect of life in a country. ” within israel and militarily occupied palestinian lands , jewish supremacy is sometimes described as white supremacy , as in this headline : “ israel ’ s white supremacy agenda targets other jews , arabs , africanspalestinians are not the only target for israel ’ s animosity and ethno-centric policies. ” this is because , contrary to zionist myth , jews don ’ t all belong to one race . the jews who created the racist ideology of zionism ( see zionism = racism ) and initially colonized palestine ( between 1882 and 1903 , at least 25,000 jews arrived in palestine , financially backed by european jewish philanthropists , such as moses montefiore and edmond de rothschild , ( see palestine and the first zionist colony ) are ashkenazim , jews of eastern european origin . ashkenazi jews are the elite of israel and they dominate and discriminate against , not only palestinian arabs , but also other jews and ethnicities in israel . however , there are two major differences between the two racist ideologies , white supremacy and jewish supremacy : 1 ) in so-called “ liberal ” circles , white supremacy is uniformly reviled , whereas jewish supremacy , as it manifests itself in zionism , is not only accepted but fiercely defended even by those middle eastern or arab jews mentioned above , who have internalized zionist racism . 2 ) jewish supremacy is wrapped up , not only in a secular zionist ideology , but in a religious one as well , attracting jews and evangelical christians from all kinds of backgrounds and ethnicities . in the wake of charlottesville , for example , the adl — anti-defamation league reported that it saw 1,000 % spike in donations . the adl is a jewish supremacist organization , but it can masquerade in the united states as an anti-racist organization . as if americans knew reports , adl “ works to maintain the racist status quo in israel-palestine , which keeps palestinians in israel as third-class citizens and palestinians in the occupied west bank & gaza stateless and without basic civil rights. ” it also keeps palestinian refugees and exiles from returning to their homes and land , an internationally recognized right . in 1994 , while eulogizing baruch goldstein , a brooklyn born jew who had emigrated to israel and killed 29 palestinian muslim worshipers at ibrahimi mosque in hebron , new york rabbi yaacov perrin said , “ one million arabs are not worth a jewish fingernail. ” he was defining the essence of jewish supremacy that now reigns supreme in all of historic arab palestine . accepting the concept of jewish supremacy in palestine , as sari nusseibeh wrote , zionist jews in and out of israel must confront the reality that jewish supremacy in israel , as david lloyd wrote about americans and white supremacy in the u.s. , “ is an intrinsic if shameful element in their history and institutions whose consequences have yet to be overcome. ” ______________ rima najjar is a palestinian whose father ’ s side of the family comes from the forcibly depopulated village of lifta on the western outskirts of jerusalem . she is an activist , researcher and retired professor of english literature , al-quds university , occupied west bank .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_47892,"white supremacy ’ s extinction burst my cat i have a cat . she ’ s a bitch . i love her , but she ’ s a bitch . in the first several months after we got her she had some bad behaviors , the worst of which was waking us up between 3 and 5 in the morning . my boyfriend brooks consulted the internet and figured out how to get the bad behaviors to stop . we had to completely ignore and endure her pouncing on our heads at whatever awful hour . during the last week or two before she stopped , she acted like an intense asshole . we were warned that during this part of the process the behaviors would intensify right before they ended for good . this is called the extinction burst . when obama was elected president and all the deep-seated , institutionalized racism , sexism etc . in american culture that hid in plain sight finally bubbled to the surface , i began to imagine the white male supremacists and their proxies gathering in their bunkers for their last stand . and then a day after trump ’ s election i finally had the terminology to describe what my anthropological brain was observing . white supremacy is experiencing its extinction burst . my cat analogy ends there , though . obviously i ’ m not going to handle the extinction period of white supremacy by ignoring it . and it will definitely last longer than a week or two , and could last longer than four years for all i know . but years of studying monkeys and human behavior as an anthropologist has stored terabytes of behavioral data in my brain , which gets automatically calculated and applied as i watch the world . the probability that white supremacy ’ s dominating hold on our culture will go extinct in my lifetime is high . my feelings the hardest part of the election ’ s outcome is sorting through all the cognitive dissonance . when it comes to people who aren ’ t my cat , i can ’ t control anyone ’ s beliefs or actions in response to trump ’ s election . but , as charles darwin said , “ it is not the strongest of the species that survives , nor the most intelligent that survives . it is the one that is most adaptable to change. ” i do have control over my beliefs and my actions , and i have decided to adapt . i can ’ t hate trump supporters . i ’ m too empathetic as a writer . yeah , i think the rich and elite who support him have a nice warm place in hell waiting for them , but i ’ m not going to concentrate my efforts on them . when it comes to the middle , working , and damn poor classes that support trump , that ’ s where i can act . a lot of people suffer from a lack of financial stability and education , even in the middle class . no one sits well with uncertainty , and knowledge defeats fear . i was definitely complacent before the election . i was going to leave it to bernie or hillary to fix everything while i continued on with my life . but because trump got elected , it placed the huge responsibility to work on the country ’ s problems on our — the people ’ s — shoulders . it ’ s an intense weight that many of us feel crushed by right now . my actions diversity is trending in the mainstream and the markets are capitalizing on it . in games , toys , and most products , people are working on including everyone . where i currently work , many major companies are requesting online courses on diversity in the workplace and why that ’ s important . in the writing field , the majority of agents and publications are searching for and accepting diverse authors and stories , specifically stating they are tired of the same old narrative . the counter force to trump and his supporters is a living , healthy , progressive organism . to keep the engines of change barreling through white supremacy ’ s extinction burst , i ’ ve decided to donate whatever i can spare to organizations that feed and educate people who are lacking these much needed resources . i want to think carefully about how , as an individual , i can act in response to whatever shitty consequences occur during trump ’ s presidency . and of course , since i am a writer , i am going to write . a lot . i have a liberal animated sitcom pilot to write that is the perfect antidote for a trump presidency . my secret optimism i ’ ve been hiding my optimism . no one wants to see it right now , and i get it . people need time to process and determine their part in this progressive push through white supremacy ’ s extinction burst . especially those who are surrounded by trump supporters . i shared my thoughts with someone recently who is on the same side of the election as me , and he said , “ i would like to believe you , but this is how hitler came to power. ” i thought of my response too late , but what i wanted to say is : yeah , we may see history repeating itself , but since it already happened , we know the future and therefore can intervene to change it ( like doc brown said in back to the future iii ) . recently , a trump supporter screamed fatphobic , misogynistic things in my friend ’ s face on the street and walked away . the woman next to her at the bus stop wished her well and another woman she didn ’ t know hugged her . the data says that ’ s two acts of kindness against one act of hate . good outnumbers hate , regardless of the election ’ s outcome . [ update 11/14/2016 : in kentucky , there are a lot of great nonprofits that help feed and educate people , many of which are in louisville and lexington . since those two counties were the only blue spots in the election , i decided to find an organization outside those cities . i chose to donate monthly to the women ’ s crisis center in covington , ky https : //www.wccky.org/ ] # whitesupremacyextinctionburst",medium_antiracist

 there are three counterarguments below :

 2 . * * focusing on * hard work * and * self - improvement * is an old argument * * , and it has n't historically depended on how bad the racism is at the present time 
 3 . present inequality * * can be better explained by other factors * * ( including structural racism )

 # race - based differences in media reporting : 

 [ a simple   might be that there are plenty of social ( "" cultural "" ) behaviors where whites perform worse , and that these * * "" problems with white culture "" * * are n't enough to make whites * worse off * , given the host of other benefits they enjoy . 

 some examples include the prevalence among whites of :

 * [ overdosing on drugs ] ( 
 * binge drinking [ ( 1 ) ] ( [ ( 2 ) ] ( [ ( 3 ) ] (   [ ( 5 ) ] ( [ ( 6 ) ] ( 
 * drunk driving [ ( 1 ) ] ( [ ( 2 ) ] ( 
 * teenage smoking [ ( 1 ) ] ( 
 * [ unprotected sex ] ( 
 * illicit drug use [ ( 1 ) ] ( [ ( 2 ) ] ( [ ( 3 ) ] ( 
 * [ carrying weapons ] ( 
 * [ involvement in mass 
 * [ involvement in white - collar crime ] ( 

 since these behaviors are   are underreported by the media relative to the "" cultural problems "" of other groups , it might indicate that * * selective reporting * * plays a role in supporting the narrative of ' black cultural problems ' as the reason for current inequality . 

 ----- 

 # it 's an old argument : 

 also - keep in mind that arguments blaming black culture are nothing new . in fact , arguments [ fairly similar to   appeared more than * * 120 years ago * * : 

 > the wisest among my race understand that * * * the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremest folly * * * , and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle [ through labor ] rather than of artificial forcing . 

 > our greatest danger is that [ ... ] we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the productions of our hands , and fail to keep in mind that * * we shall prosper in proportion as we learn to dignify and glorify common labour * * [ ... ] no race can prosper till it learns that there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem [ ... ] 

 which in modern culture is   as : 

 > both liberals and conservatives — at times across racial lines — find it necessary to preach values of * hard work , thrift and self - sacrifice * that [ such words ] could be lifted verbatim from booker t. washington ’s [ 1895 “ atlanta exposition ”   wherein he implored african americans to “ cast down their buckets ” and commit to productive agricultural labor rather than agitate for civil and human rights . 

 also - just because an argument is * old * does n't mean it 's * invalid * . hopefully , though , the fact that people were attempting to dissuade blacks from agitating for structural changes ( in favor of * hard work * and * self improvement * ) back in the 1890 's can show how little that argument depends on the actual circumstances of racism present at any given time . 

 ----- 

 # structural racism better explains present levels of inequality : 

 finally , the argument that * culture * is the root of black problems in america just does n't hold water . culture on its own ca n't explain why : 

 * police [ stop , search ,   and   black americans more than white americans ( even when controlling for * violent crime rates * and * property crime rates * for different neighborhoods ) 
 * blacks are more likely to be    and [ sentenced to   for the * same crimes * as committed by whites 
 * job applicants with white - sounding names are [ 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial   than applicants with black - sounding names 

 in summary , of the above options -

medium_antiracist_22159,"the perils ofselective decency earlier this week , i drafted a similar — though not as terrific — examination of race to greg howard ’ s on deadspin . only my piece was about sports , and my ultimate theme was that decency — rather than specifically america , or cops — was not for black sports fans . it concerned espn ’ s rash of suspensions of on-air personalities and the messages those suspensions sent , which ranged from encouraging to odd , from selective to farcical . i ’ d just arrived in a new city , to work a new job . the internet wasn ’ t set to be activated until thursday . i hadn ’ t yet sent the piece to my editors . then my computer died . despondent , i sat quietly and racked up data fees on my phone monitoring the public , emphatic and depressing invalidation of the silly notion of “ post-racial america ” as it unfolded in ferguson , missouri . as i did , it struck me that these stories — the one i ’ d lost and the one unfolding in ferguson — were linked . they are both symptomatic of the same diseased , prevalent perspective . so i sat down and wrote an entirely new piece … contempt and indecency are dished out in seemingly infinite helpings to blacks in america . there are startling , obvious examples , like michael brown being gunned down and left to fester in the sun . then there are more subtle — though still insidious — examples , like espn ’ s much-publicized suspension of stephen a. smith . i took no issue with smith ’ s suspension , nor the widespread criticism he received for his poorly-worded commentary on female complicity in male violence against them . but i almost ( not quite , but almost ) felt sorry for him , because he reminds me of a trained orca at sea world : espn had been giving him bigger and better treats every time he jumped through the hoops of shallow social criticism or balanced the ball of black cultural pathology on his nose . in that context , i understood his initial shock and indignation when his treat suddenly was swapped out for a punishment . he simply was exhibiting the asinine behavior his handlers have encouraged , and which the audience usually applauded . espn long ago decided complex , sensitive social issues were grist for the ratings mill . it wouldn ’ t have taken more than minimal coordinating to get someone on air to articulate a comprehensive , informed viewpoint on ray rice ’ s suspension as it related to larger societal discourse on domestic abuse and misogyny . the network , though , rarely demonstrates interest in comprehensive , informed viewpoints , instead attempting to reduce even complex and sensitive social issues to an easily digestible highlight clip . ergo , smith was given his long , dangerous leash , and it was impossible to then set aside skepticism when network higher-ups expressed surprise and disappointment that he inevitably got tangled in it and started to choke . for years i ’ ve tuned into espn to get sports updates , only to be bombarded — on air , in print , over radio waves — with commentary by smith and others fueled by antiquated , offensive notions of black cultural pathology . examples range from the leadership capability of black athletes from single-parent homes being legitimized as a talking point , to the discussion of richie incognito calling jonathan martin a “ half n-gger ” shifting abruptly to the culpability of “ the black community. ” smith ’ s contribution to this noxious brand of victim-blaming and race-baiting is particularly galling because he is cloaked in the cheap , threadbare garb of a voice of “ the black community. ” but smith damn sure wasn ’ t raised in my community , and he doesn ’ t represent my concerns or experiences , nor those of the bulk of blacks i know . plus , blacks as individuals take offense to white people discussing “ the black community ” as a monolith ; why then be fine when a black person commits the same sin ? in truth , smith ’ s main , flimsy credential to wax pseudo-philosophical on how blacks should feel is that he has dark skin . he ’ s not a clarion voice of any community ; rather , he ’ s a low-rent provocateur . he doesn ’ t have a ph.d. in sociology or african-american studies ; he wasn ’ t a social columnist with years of attending pertinent conferences under his belt ; he hasn ’ t been analyzing data or studying the most current and thorough articles and books on these subjects . he has no bonafides , but he ’ s allowed to — encouraged to — discuss race and society because he tends to say things that reinforce popular , base notions of black people in general , and black athletes specifically . no other group has to deal with condescending , contrived spokespeople like this . can you imagine a cartoonish wasp constantly penning pieces with sloppy historical takes and blanket indictments of “ white culture ” along these lines : media personalities as caricatures of other races or faiths would be out of a job practically before hashtags demanding their ouster were conceived , but i ’ ve read and heard and watched similar takes regarding black athletes for years . it ’ s sickening , it ’ s indecent , and it ’ s evil . it has to change . decency is a value , and as such shouldn ’ t be contingent on the market share of the offended party , nor the literal or cultural capital they wield . one of the brilliant aspects of toni morrison ’ s the bluest eye was the breedloves living in a store window . it was symbolic of how black life is always on front street , to be picked apart . our dysfunction can not be tucked neatly away , in outwardly lovely homes on tree-lined streets with the curtains drawn tight , or in the offices of doctors who double as family or friends , far from scrutiny and often off public record . this hit me hardest when i attended what was then ranked as one of the best colleges in america and saw “ good ” children of upstanding , wealthy white families doing copious amounts of drugs , binge drinking , passing around stds like gossip , and using the “ morning after pill ” as casually as a breath mint . later i went to graduate school in a town that hosted a nearly all-white student body which was perpetually drunk , loutish , violent , and boasted a percentage of ( reported ) rapes that put even other big universities with popular sports programs to shame . but i never heard or read a peep in either place about any possible cultural issues , or white dysfunction . i did , however , read and hear an unquantifiable amount about black cultural pathology during that time , often from the same people who were perpetuating dysfunction . the key footnote in brown vs. board of ed . was made by black psychologist kenneth clark , who posited that segregation was as harmful to a majority group as it was to a minority group . in other words , whites in america tend to view integration as an ameliorative measure for blacks , when it was meant to ensure the psychic health of the entire country . what clark understood was that a collective white superiority complex in this country was just as damaging to whites as it had had been to so many blacks . this disturbing rationale can be taken a step further , to a level so warped that it ’ s difficult to process : when a black person has something awful and unthinkable happen to him/her , ( s ) he can garner less basic sympathy than a white person who does something awful and unthinkable . this is what makes some whites in this country so frightening : they are doggedly and blindly determined to preserve a false sense of innocence . as james baldwin wrote , “ no one is more dangerous than he who imagines himself pure in heart : for his purity , by definition , is unassailable. ” it ’ s this belief system that allowed some white people to see trayvon martin not as a teenager walking home with some skittles , but as a weed-smoking thug who deserved to die . it allowed the same people to view a photo of george zimmerman with a bloody nose and a cut on his head and conclude that his life was definitely in danger . ferguson teenager michael brown ’ s narrative shifts from a tragic victim of abusive police power to a shoplifter and gang member ; protesters with their hands in the air become rioters ; people on their own streets , in their own yards , become trespassers . meanwhile , a white police officer wielding an automatic rifle and betraying both his civic duty and the constitution openly refers to the citizens of his own town as “ animals ” while dismissing a reporter ’ s inquiry . baldwin also wrote “ people who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction , and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster. ” this ignorance of innocence has turned our country into a horror show that can ’ t be changed so long as everyone is busy pretending they don ’ t see it . ferguson is now our figurative fork in the road . i do not invoke the words of mlk lightly , but it is up to the decent among us to choose where we go from here : community or chaos ? we have a chance — indeed , a duty — to elevate the discourse on race , class , media and human dignity . we absolutely must force conversations about the larger implications of the spirit and philosophy that demeans so many blacks and relegates us to the scrap heap in this society . and no one , including espn , can afford to allow the public faces of their network to cater to the lowest passions and biases of a public in social crisis . it ’ s in all of this that howard ’ s sentiment resonated with me in the same way that a moment from baldwin ’ s uncollected essays did . in trying to sort through the unsolvable riddle of white american contempt for blacks , baldwin expressed a final exasperation , concluding there was nothing a black person can do to convince a white person of his/her fundamental equality . he wrote — i ’ m paraphrasing here — trust me , i ’ ve sat at the bar and ordered every respectable martini there is . his point was that racism can not be cured by assimilation , good behavior or sophistication , because it ’ s a fundamentally illogical disease of the heart and mind . despite this , i believe plenty of america already is for blacks , and plenty of white americans can see the sickness that has displaced the best human instincts of empathy , fairness , respect and decency in many of us . an ultimate , resolute cynicism will never be a solution , and would undermine the decency and caring shown by a large number of my white friends . but we need help . we can not go it alone . we are tired . the harping on black cultural pathology , the victim-blaming , all of it has to end . there ’ s a thick tension hanging in the air . we need help , cooperation , and fellowship . when w.e.b . dubois asserted all art is propaganda , he had his mind on importance of a group controlling its collective narrative . the images and ideas that make their way around television , run in newspapers , and dominate popular film and literature influence societal discourse to an incalculable extent . propaganda — that is to say , the public presentation of narrative — allows unfounded opinion and flimsy belief systems to dictate experience and slant observations rather than have experience and observations inform conclusions . and what we see and hear on television — whether via news , films full of one-note black characters , or ill-conceived social commentary on espn — contributes to events like those in ferguson . what we ’ re seeing in ferguson , missouri , and what we see every day on sports tv programming are related . smith was suspended , ultimately , for being indecent . he was forced to issue a public apology after multiple missteps . it was all deserved , but it left me wondering : where is my apology ? the elephant in the room is that we ’ ve been raised within a culture that gives a nod to the exploitation of others : we manipulated the native americans ; enslaved blacks and had them work our fields for our own profits ; forced the chinese into building our railroads ; pay mexicans less than a living wage under the table to work 80 hour weeks at jobs few others want . of course we have to question the nfl ’ s handling of cte — white people don ’ t seem to have basic empathy for those they view as different , as lesser . which leads us to another question : are whites fit to coach ? to lead men ? few remember clark ’ s footnote , and fewer have heeded it . when some whites do wrong , they view themselves and their children as — to quote my private high school headmasters ’ rationalization — “ good kids making bad decisions. ” but when black people do wrong , they are reaffirming what whites already knew : they were never good in the first place .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_40036,"race , class , the hierarchy over nature it boggles the mind to consider the persistence of racism . don ’ t we know better than to believe “ white ” people are superior or that the us is “ our ” country ? didn ’ t we all learn in school about the evils of slavery and nazism , that europeans took this land away from native americans , that the us has been a multiracial nation of immigrants since before it was founded ? one way to make sense of the senselessness is to consider how race and other convenient differentiators such as nationality or sex serve a function within our socioeconomic system : to structure the hierarchy of entitlement to control over the sources of wealth and power . perhaps this function is a necessary feature , not of any human society , but of any society based on the exploitation of nature . in a system of exploitation , there must be a way of determining who gets priority in access to and disposition of choice resources before they are used up . we purport to use neutral tools , money and property rights , to perform this function , but they have systematically accrued in a pattern that duplicates , legitimates , and intensifies the underlying hierarchy . the truth about this system is not taught in school . instead , we learn the falsehood that our system rewards any individuals who work hard , regardless of demographic distinctions . and we learn that humans preside comfortably over nature , not that we are embroiled in constant struggle against each other to consume it first . if only we were taught to see the role of nature-exploitation in structuring our society , we might learn to live in harmony with all life , especially each other . but even this explanation over-simplifies . it is not as if all native-born white men get to share control over wealth and power . even within “ privileged ” groups there are vast inequalities , delineated along different divisions , such as having a college degree or not , living in an urban or rural community , being a professional or “ unskilled ” worker . but these subtler factors only reinforce racism , nationalism , and sexism ; they impose pressure on the lower rungs of the “ privileged ” classes who vent their frustration through discrimination along those more prominent lines . this subsidiary discrimination provides both the psychological relief of scapegoating and the slight material advantage of maintaining a somewhat higher status in the hierarchy than those who are not white , male , or native-born . nor is every individual who enjoys greater wealth and power necessarily native-born , white , and male . ultimately , it does not matter to those with wealth and power who sits besides them at the top of the hierarchy , so long as there are not too many peers . all that matters is the continuing existence of the hierarchical structure itself , and it just so happens that the aforementioned divisions are very convenient for sorting and maintaining such a hierarchy . even more useful is the extent to which the existence of divisions along these lines is obscured by the occasional non-white , non-native , etc . who can be held out as evidence either that the system really is merit-based and fair or that the less deserving really are stealing what rightfully belongs only to white natives . in his characteristically eloquent and thought-provoking recent essay , ta-nehisi coates diagnoses white supremacism in the belief “ that most americans — regardless of race — are exploited by an unfettered capitalist economy ” and therefore that the key “ is to address those broader patterns that afflict the masses of all races… ” at first blush , coates ’ s diagnosis would seem to apply to the argument above . however , i propose the following distinction : exploitation is a broad pattern afflicting most people of all races but not regardless of race . rather , race plays a central role in structuring and maintaining the hierarchy of exploitation . that hierarchy afflicts all races but in different ways and to different degrees . poor white people are exploited by the system of concentrated wealth , but they also benefit from the greater exploitation of those farther below them in the hierarchy , especially black people . this differential exploitation ensures that poor white people are incentivized to maintain the hierarchy . i read coates not as disagreeing with this distinction but rather as disagreeing with those who argue that , because exploitation afflicts members of all races , we should drop “ identity politics ” and focus purely on economics without the distraction of race issues . that would be a mistake . just because poor white people are victims too of economic exploitation does not mean that black people are victims in the same way or degree . and such differential exploitation may call for different remedies ; for example , reparations may well be justified for black communities but not necessarily white ones . similarly individualized consideration and remediation should be given to the ongoing histories of exploitation of other groups , such as women and first peoples . only by overcoming each particular facet of hierarchy can we overcome hierarchy itself . religion and capitalism are two sides of the same coin in many ways , not least in how they both project humans as occupying a privileged position entitling ( some more than others of ) us to exploit nature . relatedly , both create a system of values , moral or monetary or more often both , to guide our choices and provide us meaning . what alternative may be counterposed to these all-consuming , world-ordering ideologies ? it should be a perspective that maintains humans ’ privileged status , for we will accept nothing less . fortunately , there is a distinctively human capacity that can serve this role — reverence , not for gods or spirits , money or technology , but reverence for nature itself . as far as we can tell , we are the only organisms who contemplate and appreciate nature for its power and beauty . thus , an attitude of reverence can satisfy our need to conceive ourselves as special and superior , but without justifying exploitation . it readily provides a value system , too , based on preservation and conservation . a further advantage : although nature is a social construct insofar as we perceive and conceive it mediated through human consciousness , it is inextricably grounded in the reality of here and now , in contrast to the abstractions of faith and finance , which so easily lend themselves to fear and fraud .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_16428,"yes , america . we can still be pretty darn racist . january 20th , 2009 was a symbolically important day in american history . however , thanks to chief justice john g. roberts incorrect reciting of the presidential oath of office , history would not be made formal , until the next day . on january 21 , 2009 , when the oath of office was re-administered at the white house , president barrack hussain obama would become the first black man , in america ’ s 233-year history to become president . or was he ? i am not suggesting that barack obama was not the first inarguably black president in u.s. history . however , the question i am posing to you is , why is it that obama was considered a black man categorically from the moment he was born ? obama ’ s father , barack obama sr. was a kenyan senior governmental economist , and indeed a black man . however , his mother ann dunham , born in wichita , kansas , was indeed a very white woman . therefore , technically speaking president obama , genealogically biracial and therefore was just as much white as he was black . however , as most of us can probably agree , individuals who are biracial or multiracial , are almost exclusively considered racially not to be white . the reasons that biracial or multiracial persons are almost always categorized as being non-white is a result of a socially accepted ignoring of america ’ s historical underbelly . the reason that president obama or any person of mixed racial heritage is considered to be non-white is the result of the lingering effects of the “ one-drop rule. ” the one-drop rule was a historically prominent racial classification in the united states throughout the 19th and 20th centuries . in essence , the one-drop drop rule was a social and legal principle that said if a person had even one ancestor of sub-saharan-african ancestry they were considered to be black . throughout american history , the one-drop rule was not just a sociological attribute . rather , at times it was a legal standard . in 1853 , virginia became the first state to propose the establishment of a one drop rule state law . amazingly , and i seriously mean that this is senselessly incredible , virginia failed to pass the one-drop rule into law after legislators decided that the law would adversely affect white people , as they were aware of the many generations of interracial relationships that they were , themselves , descended from . in essence , the virginia lawmakers didn ’ t pass the law in 1853 , because they realized the law would indeed classify many of them as african americans . take a moment to consider that . these lawmakers proposed and debated the legitimacy of a law that would have made hypodescent legal . they wanted to legally justify their racial superiority , all while realizing that they indeed would have technically fallen in the proposed inferiority racial and social class . never fear , though , from 1910 to 1930 , seventeen states in america , including virginia , would adopt and pass “ one-drop ” statutes to cover the legal status of a person ’ s race . virginia lawmakers , still being the forward thinkers they were , passed the “ pocahontas exception ” to their “ one-drop ” legislation . now , i can not make this up , and again take a moment to sit and think on this one , the “ pocahontas exception ” stated that anyone who was 1/16th native american could be considered legally white . the reasoning , well , of course , many of the wealthy and influential fist families of virginia enjoyed claiming descent from the american indian pocahontas and her white husband , john rolfe . to recap here , the wealthy and influential virginians wanted to enjoy all of the privileges that whiteness afforded them at the time . this right included social and legal superiority over full-blooded native americans . however , they wanted not to lose any claim to being even more special by associating themselves to a being related to the daughter of the paramount chief of the tsenacommacah indians . lastly , the first register of virginia ’ s bureau of vital statistics , walter plecker , a less-than-charming white supremacist , would change all virginians who were considered to be mixed-race as being black . plecker helped establish , the 1940 , “ racial integrity act. ” fortunately , the u.s. supreme court struck down the racial integrity act and one-drop rule as being unconstitutional when they ruled against virginia ’ s law prohibiting interracial marriage in loving v. virginia . of course , it only took them 27 years , since loving v. virginia was ruled on in 1967 , a full three years after the 1964 civil rights act . now , this brings us to today . ultimately , obama or any other biracial or multi-racial person is always labeled as being non-white is because the concept of the “ one-drop rule ” is still socially prevalent today . admittedly , most biracial or multi-racial individuals , like president obama , voluntarily claim their non-white heritage as being their dominant racial identity . however , this in itself is representative of the collective racist consciousness that still lingers in the american mind today . the legal definitions may not exist today . however , the automatic assignment of inferior social class for individuals who are non-white is alive and well . ultimately , this is why people born from mixed racial union , such as president obama , are considered to be black . it is a product of social exclusion and therefore forces bi-racial individuals to identify with their non-white heritage solely . the predominately white society almost universally rejects bi-racial individual ’ s “ whiteness ” regardless of one ’ s inherent racial genetics . there exists this fanciful notion by some that people of multi-racial heritage claim their minority status solely as a means to “ play the race card ” to gain some privilege . assuredly , this fable has roots in the anti-affirmative action crowd . understandably , if one was to go searching you could find some isolated evidence that supports any pre-existing notion one can have . however , ultimately the concept of using one ’ s “ blackness ” as privilege is symptomatic of a propagated racial fear towards minorities taking something from the white majority . this is similar to the real estate fear mongering that contributed to “ white flight ” in the mid-twentieth century . ultimately , what all of this demonstrates is how utterly ridiculous it is to characterize individuals by the color of their skin . the remnants of america ’ s torrid racial past continue to force people who are not of “ pure white ” heritage to ignore life experiences , their community or their personal self-identification . citizens in america are still inherently classified from birth based on the color of their skin . if you can ’ t comprehend how ridiculous it is to judge others by skin color , just remember the reasoning for why virginia never passed a “ one-drop ” law in 1853 or their clever “ pocahontas exception. ” truthfully , the fact that americans of biracial birth are exclusively labeled in societies mind as non-white demonstrates the importance that america places on skin color . additionally , it demonstrates that america is in fact , still pretty darn racist . whether , it we like to admit it or not . in the end , we are simply human beings . our race shouldn ’ t disconnect us from each other . our religion shouldn ’ t separate us from each other . our politics should never divide us against each other . lastly , our wealth shouldn ’ t classify how likely any of us are to achieving our dreams . we are all simply just human beings . all the other mess we add ourselves .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_42291,"there hasn ’ t been enough talk , in these blasé , media-saturated times , of our growing tendency to embrace the hyperbolic , to magnify words and blow ideas out of proportion to what might , with some suspension of disbelief , be demonstrable in a real world . much of this inflation , i suspect , has had to do with simple boredom . take “ racism , ” a thing of which there ’ s been enough talk to trivialize the most serious matter , the kind of new-and-improved , concentrated , red bull , starburst , snapple mango flavor explosion that consumers of news have come to expect lately , and in super-sized format . our heightened perception of this sensation ’ s incredible size is the combined effect of a mind-numbing internet in our faces at every waking moment , and calculated campaigns to exaggerate for political gain , to sell papers and to clickbait . as the device-addicted walk down any sidewalk , drive down any highway , ride any subway , sit at any café — sit on any toilet — that same familiar soundtrack colors their mundane days and merges with the landscape . repetition gives this “ racism ” thing a 3d aspect . people start to see it everywhere from airplanes to park benches . once shocking for its rarity , this “ racism ” thing seems to have evolved , in the minds of many , into a kind of physical entity with concrete qualities . whatever it is or isn ’ t , this thing has assumed the status of an actual thing . if the new york times is reporting accurately , it laces the very lifeblood and foundations of our entire society and all its institutions , an enemy from within and without , corrupt and corrupting to the core . so inextricable this thing and irredeemable anyone or anything tainted by it , the sole solution would be to level the landscape and rebuild from scratch . sound familiar ? pervasive and penetrating , attached liberally and literally to everything , completely beyond our control , “ racism ” would now appear to have a will of its own . a recent academic theory called “ unconscious bias ” has helped breathe life into the creature , and precisely by claiming it moves about freely and undetected — deflecting , somehow , so much publicity — in some sort of “ unconscious ” dimension . this thing walks among us stealthily , cloaked by “ unconscious bias , ” a fiction fishy from the start and since discredited , but able to survive exposure to doubt and disproof , enhanced as it is by the flattering belief that insidious “ racism ” is invisible to all but a cult of visionaries calling themselves “ woke. ” spread into the water supply , morphed into a toxic substance with bad intents , like that expanding alien organism in the blob — those kids tried to warn the authorities , but they just wouldn ’ t listen ! — or that day-glo green slime in ghostbusters , the thing would appear to be solid but shape-shifting and slippery , able to insert itself anywhere , needing to be ferreted and flushed from every nook and cranny before seeping into infrastructures and giving us all bad vibes . if ever we needed proof of the internet receiving signals from both lowly pop culture and higher education to make smart people lazy , and simple people think they have something to say , it would be the inflation of “ racism ” like a helium balloon on the eve of a macy ’ s parade . the ropes have been cut , the cartoon unmoored , minds unhinged . first conjured up in esoteric word games by academic experts — whose job is to keep half-baking ideas faster than we can deflate them — born on campus , the thing has escaped over ivied walls to wreak havoc across the land . racism , son of racism , the return of racism would be good titles for the poli-sci-fi drama many people ( who vote ) are living as they go about their otherwise dreary lives , eyes glued to those handheld devices and ignoring all around them . anyone with a rudimentary capacity for human language , crude typing skills and a meme app is free to toss about confidently erudite , sciency-sounding terms like “ unconscious , ” “ systemic , ” “ structural , ” “ phobia ” and “ spectrum , ” and to feel smart and righteous for it . rather than make consumers more savvy about media and skeptical of shadow tricks on screens , spending their lives on the internet has made them more gullible . not even those television talking heads to which we once looked for guidance can be trusted to set us straight . i remember a time , only a few years ago , when certain cnn announcers still dared to roll their eyes on camera over a so-called “ war against the black man , ” the sole motive , and justification , behind a wildly popular youtube hit called black lives matter . dissent has since been mainly silenced — or skeptics converted — and daring to contrast real-world data , and common sense , with a handful of viral videos has become but further proof of this “ racism ” we ’ re all supposed to avoid like the plague . to deny its existence is to invite scrutiny . congressional interrogations , to determine who ’ s been infected , could be just around the corner . sound familiar ? in the same genre as a recent wave of books , films , and internet t.v . series resurrecting the vampire theme , run its course but with a good many people ( who vote ) still believing the undead are a real thing ; and haunted house shows where high-tech ghost hunters capture fleeting images of restless spirits in basement corners — “ you can see them , right there on camera , ” a journalist friend , who writes for the new york times , once told me , in earnest — exposure to more technology hasn ’ t put a dent in our very primitive understanding of media , in our willful ignorance of editing and special effects , in our failure to consider a little thing called context . since audiences thought a moving train would fly off the silent screen and crush them , or as many filmgoers still believe , actors make up the stories as they go , technology hasn ’ t served to evolve our faculty of judgment . some of those horrific police shootings relayed by androids were , in fact , reflections of real-world tragedies , but few were as cut-and-dried as interpreters with agendas were quick to have us understand . and whatever isolated truths these scarce but dramatic segments may or may not have revealed , we had no reason to jump to the conclusion that they represented the tip of some sort of terrible iceberg right under our feet . the most shocking believe-it-or-not story of the 21st century thus far : there was no iceberg . i often stop , not to text something that can probably wait , or receive instructions on where to turn on the sidewalk , but to wonder if hindsight will ever benefit consumers of new technology who live in a perpetual present where their every step is guided by a screen . will they pause one day , while adjusting their earbuds or downloading the latest app , to ponder how chasing an electronic mirage has torn apart untold numbers of friendships and families , polarized a nation , brought more danger to the streets , corrupted the press , pushed a great democracy to the brink of self-destruction ? or will they go on seeing the “ racism ” epidemic through a critical lens as just more “ racism ” ? will they look back , when bedlam really does come knocking at their doors , and point fingers at the mainstream journalists turned fearmongers and conspiracy theorists , the analysts turned sophists , the teachers turned indoctrinators , the politicians turned snake oil salesmen , the neighbors turned vigilante starfleet warriors — will they keep lists of who did what to whom and hold the guilty accountable for a poli-sci-fi reign of terror ? will they stop imagining things — or will this “ racism ” thing keep growing with a life and a will of its own because the internet is where we live , and if it ’ s on the internet then it must be real ? the future doesn ’ t looking promising . this “ racism ” thing has been losing its metaphorical effectiveness — which defines it as a cliché — mutating into something more exciting called “ white nationalism , ” the sole motivation behind having national borders , warn the “ woke. ” then there ’ s the final word in souped-up multisyllabics , this “ white supremacy ” thing , a state-of-the-art villain that threatens to overtake the world in sheer millions of google search results . what could top something that ’ s supreme ? flip on any t.v. , radio , handheld or home device at any time of day or night , and one might be convinced “ white supremacist ” zombies are roaming the countryside in herds , spreading their alien sickness as they go . the enemy could be living among us in seed pods like embryonic body snatchers , gestating in our chests and clawing to get out , spawning like gremlins in trump tower , hiding underground awaiting a signal , circling in spaceships for a full-scale invasion from the sky . orson welles would be green with envy over how persuasive mass entertainment has become . foreign policy magazine warns us that “ fear ” and “ white nationalist terrorism ” are being “ spawned ” by “ online racism , ” and by the “ mass media ” ( fp excluded ) which “ is ” — isn ’ t like or comparable to — a “ vector ” ( i.e. , a pathogen-transmitting organism ) . alexandria ocasio-cortez tries not to lose all sense of distinction between reality and poli-sci-fi metaphor , but she feeds the hysteria by tweeting : “ white supremacy is like a virus . supremacists are those who have been completely overcome by the disease , but supremacy — the virus — exists on a larger scale beyond just the infected . it also lays dormant. ” she types hurriedly , in her own comment section , while still holding the mob ’ s attention : “ white supremacy is often subconscious . & clearly , our nation has not been inoculated . ws is our nation ’ s original sin ; the driving logic of slavery , of native genocide , of jim crow , of segregation , of mass incarceration , of ‘ send her back. ’ it never went away . it was just dormant. ” how can one possibly argue against such a gargantuan mass of gobbledygook ? these thrilling scenarios ( or “ narratives , ” as the academics say to impress us with their critical remove ) are deeply imbedded in our imaginations , tentacles firmly anchored in our minds . poli-sci-fi tales are becoming the only stories some people know . have no illusions . democratic candidates won ’ t try to clear up this mess of green goo , because like the hunt for “ communists ” in the classic age of science fiction , too much has already been invested in fighting it , and too much is at risk for suggesting it ’ s nothing worth fighting over . lined up on stage is a cast of marvel comics superheroes , each claiming to possess the superpowers needed to search and destroy this “ white supremacy ” evildoer — donald trump , and the half of the nation that supports him — wherever it lurks . trump may be a little nutty , i ’ ll admit , but these guys have clearly gone off a cliff . a registered democrat for all my adult life , i ’ ve heard enough of their hyperbole , seen too much of their damage . dreading the future they would bring , i ’ ll be staying home on november 3rd , 2020 .",medium_antiracist

 granted , they 're fucked up concepts - but they have had a real impact .   ignoring them does not mitigate anything that has been made worse by their existence .   it just allows you to ignore the causes of issues . 

 forgetting about race would just be sticking out heads in the sand .   the problems do n't go away , we just do n't see them .   this has been the preferred policy of liberal white folks fore decades - this is where the whole "" colorblind "" bullshit comes from .

reddit_antiracist_73621,"^^^truth 

 the point of the issue is that white spaces have historically be used to oppress others . saying white women were n't involved in this is adverse to history . white female kkk members , white females having picnics with thier kids under a lynching in 1964 , white females actively involved in protesting the addition of blacks to the democratic party , a white female first lady stating how blacks are super prediters . 

 there are many examples of white females benefiting from white patriarchy as much as white men . so even if they are marginalized they are still not as restricted as others . 

 the oppression olympics is the only game you do n't want to win as it results in exstiction . genocide is the end of this set of games . if we include all oppressed people 's globally several african countries and palestine are in the lead . all other winners are dead . why the hell would anyone want first prize ? 

 the final thought i have is that spaces restricted by language are the same as spaces restricted by race . any bilingual person will tell you that they change language when they want   a to keep a secret from someone who only speaks english . anyone who can read the sign is welcome to the event . is it in cantonese ? do n't go if you ca n't speak it . is it in spanish ? do n't go if you cants speak it .

medium_antiracist_4504,"comment hi martin , a few thoughts on your points . is geographical proximity really a factor ? if you look at terrorist attacks in australia such as the sydney hostage crisis of 2014 , the media coverage , reader engagement and levels of empathy were all at maximum . so in a globalised and connected world i would discount proximity as a significant factor , especially given lahore is a modern metropolitan city with no lack of communication and transportation infrastructure . logistics would definitely be a more significant factor in covering a place like yemen . another interesting point to note is that australia-indonesia air routes carry more annual passenger traffic than australia-uk routes ( and are much closer ; source wikipedia ) , yet there was far greater worldwide and australian coverage of the london 7/7 attacks than any of the indonesian ones ( of which ironically i remember only the bali one because of european casualties ) . let ’ s instead deconstruct the culture factor . those who have travelled a lot will usually agree that today the cultural homogeneity across urbanised areas of the 'developed ' and 'developing ' nations outweighs the cultural divides in general , bar a few exceptions . this is the consequence of decades of globalisation , free market capitalism and colonial legacies . in fact i would say cultural affinity is a misnomer here because socially , economically and politically i have far less in common with the american right , for example , than i do with the progressive , liberal , educated masses of many developing nations like pakistan , malaysia , china etc . yet coverage of american incidents will of course always overwhelm anything else happening in the world . so actually , if you try to dig under the ambiguous umbrella term of 'culture ' , it is actually the psyche of creation of the 'other ' that is at issue here , rather than just the differences in cultural , social or economic value systems . and my observation here is that this psyche is created by passive racism that has been institutionalised in media and our collective mindset , bolstered by each reinforcing the other in a loop . because such racism is non confrontational and pervasive at a collective rather than individual level , it is more problematic to identify and address . this explains the reduced levels of empathy for murdered children in turkey who were too young to have a cultural identity to distinguish and other-ise them , the innocence of youth is a universally cherished part of society that anyone should be able to empathise with . your comment on the lack of diversity in the usual editorial team is perhaps the most telling clue . i have a few more thoughts on this but this is becoming an essay in itself , so i just want to conclude that there are similarities to be found in institutional sexism in reporting historically , as well as in the rederships 's propensity towards reaffirming the perceived masculine ideal and objectification of women . instead of shrugging shoulders and accepting the proliferation of 'lad 's mags ' as a consequence of readership interests , people intervened to break this media-readership loop and reverse the passive entrenchment of sexist ideas amongst generations of minds . this is why diversity in the office space is so critical , both in gender and race . we still have rampant sexism in media , but we are making inroads . the media and readership need to actively engage to deal with racism as well similarly .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_30541,"africans and african-americans must join hands to fight aids — and now we are by linda villarosa i first attended the international aids conference in 2002 . i traveled to barcelona at the height of the hiv/aids epidemic in the african-american community with a delegation of other journalists of color from around the world , excited to cover the global gathering and share , learn and find common ground with others from africa and our diaspora . but to my surprise most of the people i met that year had no idea that hiv/aids was still a concern in the united states . when i mentioned that i was working on a piece about aids in the african-american community , another journalist asked , “ do you mean aids in africa , the issue bono ’ s working on ? ” most disappointingly several non-american people of african descent in our group made comments to the effect , “ lucky for you , aids is not a problem in your country anymore. ” we had been “ disappeared , ” made invisible , excluded from the conversation , erased . that was far from the truth . in fact , just as the disease had become “ manageable ” in the united states with the advent of anti-retroviral medication , it grabbed hold of the black community in america and hasn ’ t let go . beginning at the end of 1996 , just as many of those most affected — primarily white gay men — were coming back from the dead thanks to life-saving treatment , blacks began to account for a larger proportion of aids cases than whites ( 41 percent ) for the first time since the start of the epidemic . then ( and now ) , in pockets of america — in the south and in communities of black gay and bisexual men — african americans were acquiring hiv at rates that rivaled and surpassed many of the countries on the continent . aids had also just become the leading cause of death among american black women of childbearing age . even as the epidemic has changed over the past 14 years and six international aids conferences — mainly for the better — each time i have attended these large-scale events the nagging question resurfaces : why the disconnect between people of african descent who care deeply about the issue of hiv/aids and have so much to learn and share ? the vast majority of people living with the virus around the world are black , so why are we creating separate tables rather than all sitting together ? on july 21 , marsha martin , a long-time heroine in the aids struggle , answered the question with action . along with her co-chair , senegalese-born scientist amadou diagne , she convened the first meeting of the global network of black people working in hiv ( gnbpwh ) with over a hundred black bodies in the room at the international aids conference in durban . the goal ? to move from silos to solidarity when it comes to finding tools , technologies and targets best suited to black people in order to end the epidemic . south african researcher dr. olive shisana said she first realized the extent of hiv in black communities in the united states while working as a health statistitian in washington , d.c. in the late 1980s . “ i saw so many death certificates come across my desk , ” said dr. shisana , who returned home in 1991 and later worked hand in hand with nelson mandela on the aids issue . “ that was an indication that something wasn ’ t right. ” dr. shisana , co-chair of aids 2016 , described the goal of gnbpwh simply and elegantly . looking at the faces in the room , she said , “ this is not about sharing ideas and going back to the comfort of our own countries , but establishing a bond like an umbilical chord tied between mother and child. ” as we talked and listened to each other , one point became crystal clear : people of african descent , on both sides of the ocean , have long been leaders in the 35-year epidemic , and often without credit . in the room : a prominent u.s. legistator , former white house aids “ czar , ” a former united states global aids coordinator , several members of the president ’ s advisory council on aids ( past and present ) , a high-ranking national institutes of health official , and several directors of well-respected ngos . congresswoman barbara lee , who has authored or co-authored every major piece of hiv/aids legislation in the u.s. , pointed out that , quiet as it ’ s kept , black american legislators spearheaded both the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria and pepfar — which changed the course of the epidemic worldwide . in 2010 , members of the congressional black caucus were also instrumental in lifting the discriminatory u.s. travel ban that had kept people with hiv from entering the country for 22 years . “ it was african americans who led the way , but don ’ t get recognized for it , ” says lee , also naming representatives eddie bernice johnson , maxine waters and donna christensen as her cbc allies . “ we have the documentation because we don ’ t want history to be revised. ” though numerous challenges remain , sub-saharan africa has seen huge hiv successes , again , largely driven by black leaders . deaths have dropped and growing numbers of plwha have gained access to treatment . of the 17 million people on arvs worldwide , 10 million are in eastern and southern africa . “ i must boast and say my region has really moved ahead , ” says sheila dinotshe tlou , director of the unaids regional support team for eastern and southern africa . we can not sit on our laurels , but we have seen a real saving of lives. ” african americans have much to learn from our brothers and sisters on the continent . solutions are not “ one size fits all , ” and we have seen too often that we don ’ t fit comfortably into the prevention and treatment models left over from an earlier era of the epidemic . to be blunt , they don ’ t work . as in africa , the african american aids epidemic has hit communities that are least able to fight back — poor , disenfranchised , riddled with stigma and discriminatory laws . “ the best practices in africa can be translated well to the u.s. , ” says tlou . “ we can work together with the diaspora to help each other . we don ’ t need to invent new ways. ” still , africa , black america and the caribbean must address a key concern before we can move forward together in the hiv/aids battle : homophobia . in the united states , a cdc analysis earlier this year noted that if nothing changes , 1 in 2 black gay/bisexual men will be diagnosed with hiv during their lifetimes . there is no reason that as the hiv/aids picture has brightened , this group has been left behind . africa and the caribbean have some of the world ’ s harshest anti-gay laws , including the death penalty in some countries on the continent . there is no doubt that this kind of state-sponsored criminalization encourages the spread of hiv . we have to do better . “ we need those in the diaspora to say homosexuality is african , ” said tlou . “ when i talk to our leaders , i tell them i am a mother . i have children in all their diversity ; some are msm . they are africans ; they are people of black descent. ” in all parts of the diaspora , it ’ s also critical to understand that hiv/aids is more than just a disease ; it ’ s a human rights and social justice issue . dawn cavanagh , director of the coalition of african lesbians , brought kimberle crenshaw and her theory of intersectionality into the room , to help tie our thoughts and feelings together and remind us how oppression overlaps . “ as people of african descent , we need to be fully who are we and not allow others to define us and disconnect us , ” said cavanagh . “ solidarity is about friendship and kinship , keeping in mind that an injury to one is an injury to all. ” linda villarosa runs the journalism program at the city college of new york in harlem . she has covered the biennial international aids conference since 2002 .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_89628,"i feel that discussants in this reddit needs to understand that "" race "" is a socially constructed term , not a biological one .   while genetic markers do exist that can trace groups with related ancestral groups , and you are definitely right that they are one of the oldest traceable on the planet , they are hardly rigid racial distinctions . 

 i think that while what you termed "" teenaged angst "" is at play here , it need not be so derisive or condescending as you put it .   dealing with a step parent can complicate the relations of power within a family , especially when exaggerated by disagreements .   using arguments such as "" i pay the bills "" are a pretty common way parents ( including my own , in southern california ) obscure more fundamental arguments that question their authoritative world view .   that particular brand of ethnocentrism is another form of racism the op is having to confront . 

 as for the general "" probably being bird - flu "" comment , i think there is a strong case for seeing diseases as related to language or ancestry groups , what a lot of people might term "" race , "" or less problematically as "" ethnicity , "" as evidenced by the conflation of swine flu being brought across the border into the us through "" dirty immigrants . ""   in this case , fear of disease and xenophobia produced a very real racial profiling system on top of already - existing ones .  

 in terms of how to deal with it : i do n't think there is a clear answer based on what the op has provided .   much of it has to do with the internal dynamics of your family , which seem to at least partially rely on your stepfathers financial support .   families are n't perfect , and step - families are just as artificial as regular ones ; i think one of the most helpful ways to really go about perceiving this is separating whatever feelings you have about racism from the ones you have toward your step - father , and deciding which is the truly motivating factor behind your argument .   that being said , i 'm not a therapist .   good luck .",reddit_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_7423,"well , for starters , let ’s look at the goal of blm . it ’s kindve in the name of the movement . 

 i also come from a very conservative family ( my brother thinks the vaccine is a chip ) , however despite being a literal clone of my trump - loving dad , i am fully progressive and my fiancé is of minority descent and bilingual . we both share the same political views . but enough of political terms . 

 black lives have historically been oppressed , shamed , framed - you name it . when it comes to being white , these fears generally are n’t approached , never mind realistic . not 100 % of every situation of course , but black people are seen to be suspicious and intimidating in more cases than a white individual . it makes you feel uncomfortable , as if something is wrong with you ... yet that ’s who you are and how you were meant to live this life . it ’s unacceptable in today ’s world for black lives to be oppressed and it should ’ve never been acceptable to begin with . oppression in the forms of these unnecessary fears such as creating an intimidating image or facing charges simply because of your skin tone . 

 one name every conservative group will mention is antifa . from the other side of things , this subreddit and i will tell you that name only further supports an oppression on black lives ( or supporters in this case ) an intimidating image and does n’t actually help anything but cast hate . 

 blm protestors do n’t want to be violent in any way . it contradicts the whole point of the movement . however , there ’s no blueprint for this kind of monumental shift that we are requesting for society to accept , and rightfully so people want to see change and some are going absolutely insane . my father will focus on the couple of minutes it took for someone to beat down a business with bats on tv than actually see one of these protests in person and talk about it to somebody . most protests in general , especially in dense urban areas like boston always have a guy with a flier explaining their movement . somebody planned their day to make that simple gesture for you to feel motivated .

 allow me to elaborate on your separate point about the rejection of scientific racism . let us imagine that , having discovered that “ sickle cell disease is passed through a genetic mutation predominating among those with ancestors in regions of sub - saharan africa ” , a government is then tasked with advertising this risk to members of the public . how should they go about this ? i suppose they might simply warn the public in direct , scientific terms , for example : “ those with ancestors from sub - saharan are at higher risk of sickle cell anaemia , and might wish to attend a screening ” . this hypothetical task raises the issue of how best to communicate non - racial scientific observations to a racially - conscious public . is there a relationship between non - racial science and the social construct that is race ? if so , what is the proper relationship ?

 the relevant facts i mention are more likely to occur in a situation involving black people rather than whites : blacks are on average poorer , dense urban areas are more likely to have black residents , etc .   this situation may ( and does in the u.s. ) have racist causes ( slavery , jim crow , sentencing disparities , g.i. bill discrimination , hiring discrimination , to just brush the surface . )   these racist events / periods have created a racist system , which is something we must consider when we look at a particular event to see if it involves racism .   but the systemic racism does n't necessarily make one particular personal action reaction racist . 

 that said , if each of us does not do some part throughout our lives to address systemic racism , then that probably makes us racist throughout our lives .   some people complain about this viewpoint : why should we have to do anything to address problems with a system we did nothing to create ?   both whites and minorities feel this way at points throughout their lives .   but the same could be said for any of the u.s. social institutions : the tax system , the current status of 2nd amendment rights , the campaign finance situation , local issues ( like the lack of parks in your community ? )   take your pick of some part of our social system that you think is a problem , and that you would be willing to discuss and maybe even volunteer to fix .   any of these issues can be seen as something wrong with our system , which we did n't cause , but that we want to fix .   because we recognize that by fixing that part of the system , it is a better system .",reddit_antiracist

( morrison 2016 ) ( morrison 2016 ) wise and challenging words , morrison inspires me to rise above the fear and confusion this country seems so insistent upon holstering . the pride of white-washing is unnatural in that it perpetuates a nation that thrives on supremacy , which is fueled by fear , and marginalizes others based on xenophobic insecurities that have long been stored away in the dark and more violent corners of america ’ s skeleton closet . alongside toni morrison ’ s powerful critique on the inevitable disassociation of identity that separates immigrants from being american , the violent outcomes of white fear stems from a nation confounded by an ideology that color is the determinant of its citizens ’ value.furthermore , in dedication to the sacrifices my family made for me , the pain and love my family gifted me have given me a better chance at understanding the difference between compassion and taking action about the inequality we face in current day . inequality and the toxicity of white fear “ this is a serious project . all immigrants to the united states know ( and knew ) that if they want to become real , authentic americans they must reduce their fealty to their native country and regard it as secondary , subordinate , in order to emphasize their whiteness . unlike any nation in europe , the united states holds whiteness as the unifying force . here , for many people , the definition of “ americanness ” is color ” “ to keep alive the perception of white superiority , these white americans tuck their heads under cone-shaped hats and american flags and deny themselves the dignity of face-to-face confrontation , training their guns on the unarmed , the innocent , the scared , on subjects who are running away , exposing their unthreatening backs to bullets . surely , shooting a fleeing man in the back hurts the presumption of white strength ? the sad plight of grown white men , crouching beneath their ( better ) selves , to slaughter the innocent during traffic stops , to push black women ’ s faces into the dirt , to handcuff black children . only the frightened would do that . right ? ”",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_1000,"what matters : my perspective on several issues has evolved over the last year or so . to say that my perspective simply “ changed ” is probably misleading in that such a word might imply a 180 degree change in thought , when such a drastic change is inaccurate . “ evolved ” is truly the more apt descriptor . as an example , my thoughts on race relations in the country ( usa ) have clearly evolved . for a variety of reasons ( of which i ’ ve previously written so i will not waste your time by repeating myself ) , i have given much thought lately to what it might be like to be an african american ( more specifically , black , in this country ) today . i am far more sensitive to “ black anger ” than i was before , and i see much of this anger as justifiable . although i do not believe i have reason to feel guilty for being white ( the infamous “ white guilt ” ) , i do recognize that i have certain privileges as a white man that others do not have . to slightly modify the quote from spiderman , i have come to believe that “ with great privilege , comes great responsibility. ” ( yeah , i did it . i quoted a superhero movie to make a point . isn ’ t my first time and won ’ t be my last . ; ) ) . hence , my continued efforts writing about race . a few weeks ago , i purchased a “ black lives matter ” t-shirt and some “ black lives matter ” yard signs . we live in rancho bernardo , a relatively upscale san diego neighborhood that is predominately white ( by far ) , so i thought these could have a unique impact in our neighborhood . so far , i have only worn the shirt once on a trip to costco . i got a few ugly looks in the parking lot and one younger white guy said “ i like the shirt , dude. ” beyond that , i told myself that it should not be a big deal to wear this shirt . where i initially stared into everyone ’ s eyes with every step to see what nuanced reaction to my shirt ’ s message i might infer , i realized it was perhaps best ( and admittedly much more comfortable ) to go about my costco business doing what i could to not even think about the t-shirt/billboard below my nose . i thought it important to give off a vibe as just a white guy in a white neighborhood who sees it as completely normal to wear this shirt . if i came off as a “ prodding activist , ” i thought some of what i was trying to say with my shirt would be lost . again , it should not be a big deal to say “ black lives matter ” . that should indeed be a simple , every day thing that people universally understand as true regardless of anything else . so why the need for the t-shirt at all ? because ultimately i have come to believe that not everyone does think that black lives matter — at least not as much as non-black lives . of course i do not think that all white people have this belief . let me get that out of the way first . i will even go so far as to say that i think most of the people i am talking about may not be consciously aware of these differences in thought . unless we personally know the people , we ( whites ) simply seem to get less disturbed when darker people are impacted than when whites are impacted ( again… an obvious generalization , and perhaps too presumptive on my part , but i have recognized this in myself and it appears to be true in my interactions with many other white people ) . maybe it is that over decades we have been so flooded with images of starving ethiopians or rwandan refugees that we simply have a hard time paying attention to it anymore . maybe we have gotten numb to it… perhaps we have had a difficulty connecting the dots to understand that these are indeed 100 % full people just like us white folk . if these were our friends and family , we would certainly be interested . we probably wouldn ’ t be able to sleep at night , but we have gotten used to seeing these people as behind a tv screen only — somehow separated from us . i feel we have similarly grown numb to people in the poorer black communities of our own country . it is psychologically easier for us to not have to reconcile the fact that these people with misfortune are indeed as human as we are in every way . although it is a complicated issue , i believe this numbness — this unwillingness to put ourselves in african-american shoes — contributes to the fact that thousands of black parents are out there today teaching their teenage children about police interaction in a manner that is simply different than what my dad told me . it ’ s the difference between a “ be-polite ” discussion and a “ be-polite-or-you-might-get-killed ” discussion . in a nutshell , i believe that blacks are often unfairly targeted by police and i am a fan of the “ black lives matter ” movement as it raises awareness of these concerns . i ’ ve talked with some white folks about the “ black lives matter ” movement recently . one theme i am picking up on goes something like this : “ what ’ s up with all the ‘ black lives matter ’ people ? ” cop ’ s lives ( ‘ blue ’ lives ) matter too . white lives matter too . every life matters… all life matters. ” some will even go so far as to say , “ hey , they are being racist for saying that black lives matter. ” when i question this reasoning further , the response is invariably something like , “ well , at least they should say that black lives matter as much as our ( white ) lives . they are basically saying black lives matter in such a way that they are implying that no one else ’ s life matters but their own. ” i found this to be a very interesting and telling statement . people saying “ black lives matter ” was viewed by some white people as “ black lives matter more than non-black lives. ” i thought immediately of the black men in the 1960 ’ s with signs reading “ i am a man. ” i wonder if white men at that time reacted similarly . did they interpret that to mean : “ hey , are you implying that i am not a man ? ” . maybe . i don ’ t know , but i would bet against it . this reaction seems so incredibly insecure and defensive . perhaps it is reflective of whites losing majority status in the country , and that many may be uncomfortable with that fact . speaking for myself , “ black lives matter ” means “ black lives matter. ” it reminds me that the black experience is different than my own and it reminds me to be sensitive to that fact . black folks are not better than me , but they are also certainly not worse . and of course it is true that “ all lives matter. ” i can not easily imagine anyone arguing with that statement . the reason it may solicit groans from some black americans ( and others ) is that it appears to gloss over or even outright miss or dismiss the specific point that is being made by “ black lives matter. ” when someone says “ black lives matter , ” i believe the point they are making is “ yes , of course all lives matter , but our experience is that our black lives are not treated as if they matter as much as other lives. ” i can see how responding with “ all lives matter ” is taken by some blacks as “ shush with whatever problem you think you have . we are all equal so stop trying to make yourselves more important than anyone else. ” to which some blacks might think in response , “ do you still not understand why we have the frustrations we have ? are you still going to pretend like you have no role whatsoever — indirectly or directly — in current race relations ? are you still going to pretend that it is just us that need to get our act together ? ” i can see how the anger can grow . but — — — the recent “ pigs in a blanket ” chant that was apparently led by someone claiming to be a leader in the “ black lives matter ” movement is revolting . he apparently backtracked later , indicating that it was just joking around and that even some of the police there took part in the chanting . from my perspective though , this is not good enough . i wonder if he can not see the parallels with his chant and the frat kids singing a racist chant on their party bus several months ago . in both cases , the term “ joking around ” does not deserve to be remotely near the rest of the words spoken or chanted . this disappoints me to no end . although i do believe black anger concerning the justice system to be justifiable in many cases , this is the type of thing that completely undermines the important message that “ black lives matter ” had intended to convey . yes , it is true that this may be an isolated incident and only a handful of people that did it… but in today ’ s social media world , the damage has been done . those that we may be trying to convince and educate regarding the meaning of the “ black lives matter ” movement now have one more huge distraction . the chance that they will connect “ black lives matter ” with the underlying intent of that message has further decreased and this is unfortunate for all of us . the possibility that the hateful speech spoken by some in the “ black lives matter ” movement may have spurred murder of police officers is beyond revolting . of course “ blue ” lives ( lives of police officers ) matter as well . i believe that the majority of police officers do truly care about serving the public . that is incredibly important to remember . the fact that many black folks have justifiable reasons to fear the police , however , does shed light on the complications in that relationship , but it certainly does not excuse murder of police officers . again , it does not excuse murder . i have recognized that some black people simply feel they are at their wits ’ end on this issue . they feel they have been systematically attacked by police officers — often being needlessly killed by them . people might even argue “ how dare i tell them what to do , not having lived in their skin ? how dare i tell them to just keep taking it ? ” they might even argue that i am immoral , by not letting them “ fight back. ” recognizing that i remain a privileged white guy , i still have no problem saying that there need to be reasonable lines that are not crossed . calls to murder — and actual murder — of police officers clearly are on the wrong side of that line . i understand that the martin luther king ( peaceful protest ) vs malcom x ( “ by any means necessary ” ) debate has been in many ways resurrected in some black communities . i have significant respect for both men , but for what it ’ s worth i still side with mlk . i acknowledge this to be quite the convenient and self-serving stance for me as a white guy to take , but it is legitimately how i feel . i see so much power in saying no and fighting aggression ( covert or overt ) against you , but still not lowering oneself to the level of the aggressor . it is also a lesson in tact . it allows for the possibility of reaching the ultimate goal of improved race relations without using the “ nuclear response ” that can only lead to further escalation . as an aside , escalation also gives the racist charleston shooter what he says he wanted — a race war . i understand this may seem like i am asking a lot of many african americans who may be so tired of being patient . i acknowledge that some of you justifiably feel incredible anger . i respectfully ask that you please keep actions in response to this anger non-violent in nature . i , in turn , will continue to do what i can as a person with white privilege to educate my peers about why your anger is justifiable… and the “ black lives matter ” t-shirt goes on again today . i will not let a handful of misguided people take away the powerful message inherent in that statement .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_17257,"i haven ’ t seen “ ghost in the shell ” and , despite how much i enjoy watching scarlett johansson play characters that kick ass , i have no intention of doing so . i made this decision , in part , because of the whitewashing issue . and , while i get your argument , i think it ’ s problematic in two ways . in my opinion , invoking the name of bobby jindal , who is from my home state of louisiana , does not help your argument . jindal is only about four years younger than me . most non-white people around my age likely learned to assimilate to white culture as much as possible . it was a matter of survival as well as aspiration . if you wanted to be successful , you had to learn to talk and act in ways that made white people feel comfortable . if jindal wanted to graduate from high school without incident , he would probably have eschewed his indian culture as much as possible so he could fit in . that ’ s not race-bending . that ’ s a survival mechanism . i ’ m also not sure rachel dolezal helps your argument much either . she is a white woman who is self-identifying as non-white , which is not the way this usually goes in the united states . light-skinned african-americans have passed into the white race for generations , again as a survival mechanism . in previous generations , blacks who could pass as white often did to create better opportunities for their families and themselves . i would argue that the backlash dolezal ’ s getting from all sides has to do with the wholesale indoctrination into the “ white is superior ; black is inferior ” mindset we have been subjected to since our country ’ s inception . people of all stripes are wondering who in their right mind would want to be black . to many african-americans , a white woman passing as black feels like cultural appropriation because she can just walk away if the burden gets too heavy . we can ’ t . for me , the decision not to pay to see “ ghost in the shell ” is about hollywood ’ s obsessive need to cast white actors in roles that should arguably be played by people of other races . i love scarlett johansson . she ’ s a beautiful woman who looks great while kicking ass on the big screen . i ’ m a fan . i just wish she ’ d be more discriminating about the roles she accepts . i was equally unhappy with her role in “ lucy , ” where she essentially became the mother of a new human-technological race . the scene in which she travels back in time and touches the finger of presumably the real lucy , a la god touching the finger of man in the sistine chapel , was utterly insulting . if the filmmakers had any concern for the subtext they were creating , they would have at least rethought that scene . but , i digress . i wonder whether the race bending in “ ghost in the shell ” would be defended had the lead been african or argentine rather than white . i doubt it . i suspect the majority of the manga-loving community would be up in arms and calling for the director ’ s head . after all , a disturbing number of white folks freaked out at over a black storm trooper . we ’ ll never know if i ’ m right though because in “ ghost in the shell ” the japanese woman was changed to a white , vagina-less robot and that , apparently , is perfectly acceptable . that ’ s not race-bending . that ’ s a survival mechanism . to many african-americans , a white woman passing as black feels like cultural appropriation because she can just walk away if the burden gets too heavy . we can ’ t . hollywood has an obsessive need to cast white actors in roles that should arguably be played by people of other races . in “ ghost in the shell , ” the japanese woman was changed to a white , vagina-less robot .",medium_antiracist

 the contradiction lies in the fact that racism defined as prejudice plus power = racism ; is perpetuated by legal positivism . 

 which is to say ; how can the very arbiter of racism and perpetrator of racism , i.e. power , state power , institutional power ; also at the same time be the vindicator of ' social justice ' and egalitarianism ?   this overt conflict of interest is an insult to thinking people everywhere . 

 true justice is based on equal rights independent of state and the political means of administration .   true justice , justice that stands and is universal can never be subjugated or held by an institution devoted to political power .   furthermore , political power is at it 's most basic level , violence , exploitation , aggression , censorship , and war .   social justice is a neo - jacobin farce whose rooted in comteian thought . 

 legal positivism arrogates natural law and equal rights and then returns it in the form of codes and statutes which are licensable and revocable .   it is a farce .   a just law can not take rights away from anyone and still be just .   social justice seeks to accomplish this very thing through language , political force , et al ;",reddit_antiracist

 you asked the house to look at the “ simple ” answer and now you whine . hitler asked germany to accept that jewish bolshevism was the source of all their problems . he had a very “ simple ” answer . the republic of korea was under colonial rule as long as many other countries yet they are now the 12th largest economy in the world . ditto for singapore . i fear your loosely educated and simple answers . in the novel dr zhivago the idealist sasha once confronted with reality is quickly transformed into stallnikov the murderous commissar . you can redeem your superficial comment by listing other factors not related to colonialism that are connected to the current state of affairs .  
 finally concluding with :  
 well , you have n't addressed a single point i raised . not surprised though : very few indians are able to acknowledge the massive problems that plague their country . much easier to blame it on someone else . as for colonialism : australia , new zealand , canada were colonies . they seem to be doing ok .    i am sure that i will have little or no affect on a mind that lacks nuance .    it is not for your benefit or out of concern for what you think that i make my posts .    calling you to account for your "" simple "" answer is not "" name - calling "" but rather a call to defend your assertion .    you have failed to do so in an any rational manner .    you simply ( pun intended ) state that anyone who does not agree is not a competent observer . emotions are not the same as reason my friend in spite of your loose education in these matters .

reddit_antiracist_77878,"i do n't know that they are .   in the last avenger 's movies don cheddle was the but of a joke who was simply trying to show off his prowess and was laughed at by his fellow heroes who anthony mackie was nothing more than a cameo .   and it 's not like war machine was a significant player in any of the iron man movies .  

 and how many avengers are black again ?   not even black widow is black ! 

 as for the ' legacy ' characters , they had no issue casting /ben kingsly in a role that was written as an asia person . 

 you are only constrained by legacy characters when you choose to be strained by them .   the show elementary rejected both gender and race categories when casting watson .   and the marvel films stray far enough away from the original characters in the films that maintaining the original skin colour of a white character is n't really important at all .   i mean , they had a guy who is 6'1 play wolverine , who is supposed to be like 5'4 or something .  

 but yes , blade ... good call .   i forgot about that one .  

 but the fact we have to reach to think of one indicates that there is a problem .   let 's not pretend that because we can spit out a few supporting roles who are filled by people of colour that there is n't an issue with representation in the genre .

 i worry about you too and i want to see the world better for you and i 'm glad you stand with me . i 'm glad you can see how a "" see it come to an end "" personality hurts , even if it is n't intentional . 

 a long , long time ago , i used to have that bias as well with feminism because it felt like an attack on me . i had that mentally of "" well , i treat you fairly , so i 'm not bad "" and "" it 's no my fault for what society men set up "" . until i took a step back and saw the bigger picture . it 's not anti - male or exclusive at all and in fact . it 's not about if i personally made society this way as a male , but that society is this way for us as males . i shared a lot of beliefs that feminists in general have . and i realized that by resisting it , i was combatting them and a way of thinking i have . i 'm was being selfish . women just want to be equal and feel fairly represented in a world where they 're not . 

 usually i hear "" there should be no labels , we 're all the same "" . sure , we 're all just skeleton and bones , but we 're not all the same . we 're all different . we 're male or female . we 're all different skin tones . we all speak differently . we 're different orientations and religious beliefs . we have different upbringings . labels are inevitable and they 're fine , it 's when we treat people differently because of what they 're labeled as and not equally that there becomes an issue . and a lot of people being treated differently and unequals is the status quo . 

 p.s. your opinion is excellent . if it 's any consolation , whites are n't safe from profiling either . i have a dear friend of mine who use to have her hair dyed a really cool purple and green color some years back . she drove a hoopdee and was wearing a death metal shirt and she got pulled over and , without a warrant or any reasoning , the cop kept demanding to search her car . she refused , which she 's well within her rights to do . however , the cop continually pressured and harassed her during the stop until she complied to the search . found nothing . should be pretty easy by description to figure out why the officer pulled her over and escalated to searching her vehicle . that 's f'd up .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_39140,"martyrdom in three movements three black children . three american children . three murdered children . across different generations , in different inconvenience stores across the country , they are forever bound by martyrdom . i remember with horrifying detail where and when i first learned about the life and death of emmett louis till . i was not quite 12 years old and i was sitting in a 7th grade classroom . my teacher , without caution , played a documentary that i was emotionally unprepared for . up until that point , i had a limited understanding of what “ racism ” really meant in america . when i thought of racism in the past , i thought about grainy footage of “ white only ” and “ colored ” signs posted above two separate and unequal water fountains . and in my present time , racism simply meant being called a few unpleasant names as the only black kid in my middle school . but when i saw emmett ’ s face , so beaten and swollen that he was unrecognizable , something terrifying awakened in me . with the force of an earthquake , a whirlwind , and a storm , i took my first big step toward consciousness . suddenly , the word “ racism ” took on a deeper meaning for me . racism in the past was not just blacks and whites not being able to eat at the same restaurant or go to the same movie theater . and racism today did not just mean being called the n-word . it was deeper than that . suddenly , the inequalities between my school in the inner city and the schools in the suburbs didn ’ t seem quite as coincidental . i had not yet learned the vocabulary of redlining or racially restrictive covenants or white flight or mass incarceration , but at that moment , i knew that if a young black boy could be brutally murdered for the heinous “ crime ” of whistling at a white woman in the same decade that saw my mother ’ s birth , this was a hatred that was so deep that it could not be swept away in just one generation . september 23 , 1955 : not guilty . my mother is the one who first told me about latasha , back when i was just starting high school . she had been living in south los angeles when it happened , and so she knows what many still do not , that the civil unrest in 1992 was not just a response to the rodney king beating but so much more . among the causes are economic disinvestment , widespread police brutality , and the cold-blooded murder of a black child . in an inconvenience store , 15-year-old latasha harlins was at the counter with a bottle of orange juice in one hand and money in the other . talk to any black person in america today and they know the feeling . those watchful eyes hit your body like a piercing pillar of ice . latasha didn ’ t stand a chance . she may as well have walked into that inconvenience store with a ticking time bomb on her chest , for her black skin had been weaponized against her the moment she was born . shot in the back of her head as she walked away , latasha fell on the ground with the money still clenched between her lifeless fingers . november 15 , 1991 : $ 500 fine . probation . community service . “ are you following him ? ” “ yeah. ” “ ok , we don ’ t need you to do that. ” i remember clutching a newspaper that told me that a neighborhood watchman had pursued a black boy , one year younger than me , to his death as he left an inconvenience store . a hoodie and the weapon he wielded — no not the can of arizona iced tea or bag of skittles — but that terrible weapon called melanin had turned trayvon martin into the subject of a pursuit . in the twisted logic of florida law , his killer had been standing his ground by pursuing and shooting trayvon . millions of black people were reminded that night that violence against our bodies constitutes self-defense in america . july 13 , 2013 : not guilty . there are no words that i can say that can heal the generational trauma that emmett ’ s , latasha ’ s , and trayvon ’ s deaths caused my people . while the world may little note what i say here , it can never forget who they were as living , breathing human beings . the world can never forget that without emmett till , there may not have been a civil rights movement . that without latasha harlins , there may not have been enough sparks to birth the blazing phoenix that fundamentally changed police practices in los angeles for the better . and without trayvon , there may not have been a black lives matter movement that enabled a new generation of activists to lift up the issue of police brutality to a sustained level of consciousness never before seen in this nation ’ s history . but emmett , latasha , and trayvon did not ask to be martyrs of the movement . though speaking of them as martyrs may make us feel better about their deaths , we can not pretend that they willingly gave up their lives for our empowerment . today , emmett till should have been a 75-year-old who plays with his grandchildren on the weekends . today , latasha harlins should have been a 41-year-old who just went to see her daughter ’ s school play last week . and today , trayvon martin should have been a 22-year-old who is looking forward to graduating from college next month and to a world of possibilities after that . i write of these martyrs , these angels , because i know i have a responsibility to # sayhername and # sayhisname . as ta-nehisi coates writes in between the world and me , when we get lost in the “ the sociology , the history , the economics , the graphs , the charts , ” it can be easy to forget that which is most important , that racism “ lands with great violence , upon the body. ” as much as it pains us to say their names , to remember them as they lived and as they died , we can not stop saying their names . we can not close the casket . mamie till , never a braver soul , taught us all that we must open the casket . because if we are to defeat racism as a people , the world must see the heavy burden that our daughters and sons have to bear . if you enjoyed this piece and you would like to support my writing in other ways , please check out my first short work of fiction , frederick douglass and the john brown scouts , available now on amazon .",medium_antiracist

other times because i was convinced i was a burden on the people around me . i told myself that if i wasn ’ t here , i wouldn ’ t take up space or distract people from their lives . i would be one less thing they ’ d have to help care for and that it would be a blessing for them if i died . sometimes i think this with my spouse — that if i stop existing , his life would improve dramatically . he wouldn ’ t have to hear my angry rants against the injustice in the world . he wouldn ’ t have to hold me when i cry about the things i can not change . he wouldn ’ t have to deal with the fact that i don ’ t fuck with his family at all . he could go forward and never think about the injustices that only affect him because of his proximity to me . i see myself as a burden . and i know how this happened . how i was conditioned to try to make myself small and stay out the way . how i was never supposed to be the squeaky wheel because when you are a black womxn , being noticed comes with a price that should exist . but white supremacist patriarchal capitalism put a dollar value on my existence and then made a world where nothing less than my death could pay it . my existence is tied to my ability and willingness to bear offspring , provide free labor , and be a footstool for every able-bodied , non-fat , male in my radius . i was born to be one of the least considered and one of the first sacrificed . fighting that truth only makes it easier for people to do both . “ do it for your country. ” “ i ’ d rather die on my feet , than live on my knees. ” “ the good of the many outweigh the needs of the few. ” these are just some of the sayings i ’ ve heard all my life , telling me that i should be willing to sacrifice my life for the benefit of others . that if i am not part of the machine then i am useless and unnecessary . we constantly hear debates about who deserves to live . we hear things like disability , poverty , and obesity being used to undermine our right to live . blackness is pathologized . femininity and sexual identity are weaponized . non-cisgender identity is ostracized . humanity is conditional and survival is reserved for those who fit the narrative . we are born to be the fodder of the ruthless , amoral , and powerful . when we fight , we are gaslit to hell and back . we ’ re told that we ’ re lazy , weak , inconvenient . our role is always deemed secondary to whoever most embodies the patriarchal , capitalist , white supremacist ideal . we are the foundation that those at the top of the social hierarchy stand , spit , piss , and shit upon and the mess that social climbers seek to escape . we are the fuel they use to stay warm . we are the food they eat , the water they drink , and without us , they are nothing . the goal has been to ensure we ’ re too distracted surviving to realize it , much less do anything about it . and it works . genocide is normal in amerikkka . whiteness has justified the deaths of millions in its quest for dominion . the “ greater good ” is redefined each and every time the “ elites ” power is threatened and our bodies are human chess pieces waging war against each other to protect those who are advocating for our deaths before , during and after the war . white supremacist capitalist patriarchy tells us who benefits in what ways and defines who carries that load . it defines who is protected and why . everyone else is fuel for that “ elite ” . every institution is a barrier to access basic human rights & teaches us who needs to die for white supremacist capitalist patriarchy to function . we learn this consciously & subconsciously and then bury that callousness and inhumanity in percentages to seem less cruel . in case you haven ’ t noticed , every medication and medical procedure has an acceptable death rate . every activity we do has an acceptable death rate . environmental laws , industrial laws , workplace laws — all encode acceptable death rates . by our own admission , there is always a percentage of people that are acceptable to die . we are all guinea pigs in the medical-industrial complex and social science experiments for academia . our deaths , while avoidable , are a small price to pay for “ advancement ” . at least , that ’ s what white supremacist patriarchal capitalism will have you believe . as long as those deaths are among people marginalized for being black or poor or old , or disabled or fat or gay or trans or non-christian or any number of identifiers deemed unacceptable by whiteness , it ’ s okay . we are a small price to pay to maintain the lies of white supremacy . you ’ ve been groomed to die for someone else ’ s benefit all your life and whiteness will not protect you because that ’ s the source of your demise . the fucked-up part is it doesn ’ t have to be this way . we can literally reshape how this works if we stop pretending that the status quo of cannibalizing our own is our only way to thrive . but , as a collective , we ’ re followers . the institutions are saying that it ’ s okay for people to die , so the people start advocating for that death because this is the path towards future greatness . our “ leaders ” tell us “ there are more important things than living ” . white people are literally protesting to spread this disease , mostly because they believe they are protected by their whiteness . after the news came out that the majority of people dying from covid-19 at this time are black people , the media started blaming us for our deaths . fuck all the societal inequities that continue to harm us . instead , the whiteness machine has again pathologized blackness to ensure the false image of white supremacy remains intact . the message that white people seem to keep denying is that unless they are among the “ elite ” they are just as expendable as black people . they are being fucked over by the same systems . they are choosing to be fucked over by the same systems because they think it is a worthy sacrifice for white supremacist patriarchal capitalism . they think they can use this virus to solidify their power more . and while nobody necessarily wants to die , if it means their kids will continue to benefit from white supremacist patriarchal capitalism , they ’ ll do it because this lie is the fundamental core of their being . the difference is that white people believe they have a choice in what happens to them when really , they are willing conspirators in their own demise while telling themselves that they are somehow above it all . yet , here they are protesting for the right to risk their lives for a fucking haircut . genocide is a norm for whiteness . genocide is the core of how imperialization and colonialism spread across the globe . the white supremacist patriarchal capitalist agenda is its natural evolution and it has a chokehold on the humans of this planet . we are dying under this ideology and will continue to do so as long as success and achievement are defined by cruelty , callousness , and horrific violence . white people tell themselves they are civilized while splattered in the blood of their victims and building homes on their graves . they are an out of control death cult who pretends to be benevolent . they are monsters who have sold the lie that they embody the best of humanity while they cannibalize themselves and everyone around them . as another writer said , the cruelty is the point . i was born in a kill box but i refuse to sacrifice myself at the altar of whiteness . regardless of what i ’ ve been taught , it doesn ’ t have to be this way . if you appreciate or learned from this essay , please feel free to compensate me by contributing to my paypal or cashapp . you can contribute any amount you

 people are mourning the realization that their freedom and basic human rights are considered lesser than those of others to the people who have vowed to protect and serve them simply because of what color they were born . yet , some white people are so proud over this same trait – a phenotypic trait that has nothing to do with one ’s character , nothing to do with anything one has ever worked towards ; one ’s skin color is the one thing about an individual that says the least about anything that individual has ever done or who they are as a person . yet , some white people are so proud of something they had absolutely zero say in while murdering others for the same exact thing because nothing they ’ve ever done in their life matters , and it ’s the best they ’ve got to get themselves through the day . white supremacists , neo - nazis , the kkk , the police , whatever other racist groups or lowkey racists ; anybody like this is nothing but a coward . do n’t even come into this conversation talking about , “ most cops are n’t murderers . ” great . lovely . moving on . anybody that completely disregards human life like this is worthless . they have done nothing in their lives that amounted to anything and have to rely on hundreds of year - old ideas that somehow convince them into thinking they are better than other people because of what they look like , just to get through their day . they are not better than anyone else for any reason . you are not better than anyone else for any reason . i am not better than anyone else for any reason . actually , i take that back . because white supremacists are nothing . they ’re nobody .   while they are still apparently considered people , their words and actions do n’t matter because their opinions and the things they say are wrong and we have to actively participate in the fight against these dangerous criminals and their stunted ability to think logically or for themselves . 

 meanwhile , they ’re getting through their day by making sure black people are n’t allowed to get through theirs ; they are n’t even allowed to exercise . ahmaud arbery was literally hunted by these dangerous , backward thinking disgraces to society because these individuals ( who do not deserve their names said ) mistook ahmaud jogging around the neighborhood he and the arbery family called home , as “ hauling ass from a burglary . ” to resist or turn a blind eye to the absolute societal need of all individuals to take part in deep , truthful self - inventories , reflection , and the desire to be better and inspire change indirectly contributes to this life - threatening reality . i ’m sorry ahmaud arbery . you did n't deserve to die .

 is it only okay for native americans to wear those traditional clothes ? that is n't a loaded question , i want to know your opinion . is it okay for a caucasians to wear them in admiration of the culture , even if it is overly simplified or sexed - up ?   is it wrong that i own a pair of abercrombie and fitch moccasin - style shoes purely for fashion and comfort ? should those shoes be sacred and exclusive for native americans ? 

 any time you decide your culture is off limits to humor and parody , you show insecurity in that identity . it is saying that what you come from is n't strong enough to handle the joke . 

 instead , why not roll with it ? there are parodies of all backgrounds and cultures and we should enjoy these with mirth and laughter !   the more we can laugh with and at eachother , the more comfort and ease of integration america will experience . there will always be haters and racists , and we are n't going to change them by complaining about asinine costumes . some of those people may be racists mocking your heritage , but please do not jump to that conclusion , merely because they are a different color from you . it is a form of racism in and of itself . 

 when male friends make "" get back in the kitchen , woman ! "" jokes , i laugh and tease back . why ? because laughing at something destroys its power over me . i am woman enough to laugh about the sexism of the past and never look back at that hateful past as a shackle on my ankle . a black friend of mine was black dynamite for halloween . that 's the pinnacle of racist stereotypes , and you know what ? he was mocking it . and he would have laughed if any of our white friends wore the same costume because he has confidence in his color . 

 walking on eggshells is not going to help anyone respect a different ethnicity . the only thing it does is further separate the races . it draws lines in the sand that a majority race can not cross for fear of being considered a bully . 

 i have attended native american sweat lodges and respect their plight caused by white americans of the past . your ancestors had a lot taken away from them . my heritage is a mixture of protestant racists and labor - slave irish . but we should rise above that and stop separating ourselves with arbitrary lines . costumes do not matter . laugh and move on . pointing fingers and playing victim are not going to help your cause ... instead , write to your state representatives about social issues and legislation that is persecuting your people . there is real racism going on toward your people . get involved in social movements and do some community service in the name of integrity . 

 the best way to change society is to be a shining example of the best of your people . i believe from the way you wrote this that you absolutely have that potential .. but this essay will piss off as many people as it will persuade . do not talk , do . dress up as a white conservative fundamentalist for halloween and poke fun at them !

medium_antiracist_40222,"white dispossession part 3 where did america go wrong ? this section will build off amna nawaz ’ s interview with white nationalist jared taylor . in this section , we want to dive deeper in to what type of america white nationalists are looking for and what they hope to accomplish and achieve at a deeper level . when asked about when white dispossession began , jared brings up the civil rights act of 1964 and the immigration act of 1965 . i think this response is obvious and probably agreed upon by the entire white nationalist community . the civil rights act of 1964 outlawed discrimination based on race , color , religion , sex , or national origin and the immigration act of 1965 abolished the quota system , allowed immigrant families to be reunited , and attracted skilled labors for the growing work force . it is at this point where you see the supremacist come out of jared . this was jared ’ s “ they took our jobs ” moment ( thank you south park ) . jared believes that there is no data that shows this led to skilled workers coming into the states . when amna cites that empirical data shows that immigrant families are more likely to send their children to higher levels of education as compared to “ native ” families , jared said “ people like you ” fit that data but not hispanics or blacks who take more from the economy than they give . “ people like you ” is referring to amna being muslim-american . now despite how inherently racist that statement is , it is important because we see jared make a claim , amna have data to refute his claim , and then he slightly changes his claim to fit data that amna might not have . white supremacist feed off stereotypes because that is all the data they need . jared does at multiple points throughout the interview . this will be a key point in understanding how to deal with people like jared . after this extremely abrasive statement and a few comments on her heritage , amna asks if he would have preferred the america ’ s before that time . jared still disagrees . the basis of this stems from the fact that jared believes that whites deserve a nation and borders all to themselves ( as if they already don ’ t have that ) . he believes that slaves should have never been brought here ( one thing we agree on ) because whites could have done the work in building the cotton business . he believes that asians should have not come to the states and worked with few rights and low wages because whites could have done it all a lot better . and he says this confidently as if he doesn ’ t believe this country was built by exploitation . so , white supremacists want white borders and white advocacy . despite jared ’ s personal journey to this point , he believes that how people arrive at these views doesn ’ t make a difference . all that matters are that these views are corrects , other white people are starting to feel the same way , and soon all whites will act in their own self interests . how does jared know this ? he says that donald trump is the signal for “ white consciousness ” . he says that donald ’ s desire to deport muslims and mexicans shows that he is pro-america , pro-whites , and will slow down the dispossession of whites . the question is how will donald do this and why are jared and white supremacists so confident in his ability to cause this kind of change . in my next piece we will touch on this and introduce a few more viewpoints into the conversation . we will talk about where white supremacists draw the line and why they feel their idealistic society isn ’ t a hard reality to imagine .",medium_antiracist

 my recent mental epiphany about the origins of the united states has not lessened my love for and dedication to this country . on the contrary , it has enervated me to both understand it better and support change . my years as a government employee , soldier and other employment and life have shown me that we as the “ little people ” have very little real power unless we seize it and guard it . the power of the wealthy and connected in this country is immense . the current political mess we find ourselves in is a result of this , and it goes all the way back to english law and custom . that said , these are my thoughts . i may have been naive or unread , or whatever , but recent events have been making me think critically about this country and the direction it is going . 

 i have been examining the beginnings of this country reading a book called a people ’s history of the united states by howard zinn . we were taught a fraud in school . the united states was formed , is run by and for the elites . it was formed by rich , powerful men who used the poor and continue to use them to make more money and keep the real power for themselves , with little or no consideration for nor care for , 75 percent of the people living here at the time . 

 the history books i had in school ascribed good and pure motivations to the founding fathers that simply were not there . the goal of most of the “ founding fathers ” was simply to replace the british elites that ruled the country at the time . we did not have a “ revolution ” , we had a replacement or reconvening of the same old crap wrapped up nicely in the declaration of independence and the original constitution , which of course had been substantially liberalized since its writing . 

 washington became the wealthiest man in the country and most of the others amassed great wealth . the poor and downtrodden were used by the rich then and now as pawns to fight wars and present a picture of populism that did not exist ( something that has happened forever , not just here and continues to this day ) . only about ⅓ of the country supported the rebellion . i will not deign to call it a revolution , as a revolution would bring about change . the rebellion was about changing the ruling elite , replacing the british overlords with new landed overlords that controlled the economy for their interests and those of their ilk . 

 the constitution itself was not what it is today . it did not give the voting franchise to the vast majority of people and completely ignored the native americans , slaves and non - land owners , not to speak of women . all but one of the first thirteen colonies did not give the vote to people who did not own land . only pennsylvania gave anything close to universal franchise at the time of the passage of the constitution . 

 what we need to realize is history is written by the ones paying the authors . we have been defrauded since day one and taught crap .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_60,"reverse racism ? sideways racism ? no , it ’ s just racism prejudice directed against ethnic minorities by individuals of the majority indigenous ( and typically white in a western context ) race is the commonly accepted notion of racism . although when this notion takes a different format such as a role reversal or the prejudice of one ethnic minority group directed against another , this often evokes a different reaction . indeed , in such instances , often the label of racism isn ’ t used with the same acerbity that would otherwise be expected . in fact , sometimes the label of racism isn ’ t used at all . yet surely all racism is fundamentally the same , even if by another name or no name at all ? moreover , why is racism from those within minority groups not met as it would be in the more familiar context of such prejudice ? in the communities of some ethnic minorities , undertones of racism appear to be inherent and consequently accepted . this is even apparent in some communities where in theory , multiculturalism should successfully challenge such views . race relations in western society have generally improved . racism is generally challenged and largely considered unethical behaviour . however , largely due to political correctness , it has also become somewhat taboo to candidly discuss . arguably , this taboo is what hinders any effective challenge to such attitudes existing within some communities . to suggest that an ethnic minority might be racist is less likely to be received with the same abhorrence as suggesting a white person might be racist . a white person making this suggestion could even be accused by others ( including other white people ) that in saying so they aren ’ t culturally or racially sensitive . the difficulty in challenging these attitudes is also compounded by the insularity of such communities . this further limits the scope for such views to be challenged by experience and wider interaction . even where second and third generations of ethnic minority groups acknowledge these attitudes to be wrong ( often by virtue of their increased interaction within a multicultural society ) , they nonetheless tacitly accept them , rarely deciding to instead become outspoken of what they know is unethical behaviour . some might counter that the reason for insularity within some communities is due to the prejudice they may have experienced . this is particularly in instances where immigration has been met with racism and a frosty reception by governments and the wider public . no minority group can be blamed for such a knee-jerk reaction and a disinclination to integrate within a wider society that once appeared so hostile . nonetheless , this approach has meant any existing prejudices within such communities remain unchecked as individuals are not subject to positive experiences that would otherwise refute these attitudes . unwittingly , it also supports wider racist views . take the sentiments of the bnp . while being interviewed on the bbc ’ s newsnight , nick griffin , leader of the bnp , was questioned on his view of “ mixing races ” and if he opposed this . rather than attempt to gloss over or deny this , he candidly admitted that this was his opinion ( and presumably that of his party ) but added that this was a view shared by other ethnic minority groups . unfortunately , while in a minority , there are sections of some minority groups that would share these views . in doing so , this gives credence to an ideal of a far-right party that doesn ’ t even support their presence in britain . it also illustrates the inconsistency of how racism is perceived based on who it comes from . in his bigger and blacker show , chris rock examines modern day racism — black people yelling “ racism ! ” white people yelling “ reverse racism ! ” chinese people yelling “ sideways racism ! ” like much of chris rock ’ s material , a lot of truth is astutely said in jest . and while not the central theme of his sketch on race , the notion of varying labels to describe racism is certainly accurate . the idea of reverse racism is often perceived as a form of positive discrimination or positive action but has also been used more simplistically to refer to racism that doesn ’ t conform to the more familiar notion . racism by another name doesn ’ t change the fact that someone is racist . yet giving it a different label makes the flawed suggestion of there being some nuance that supports just that . it also perpetuates an irrational and inexcusable rationale that essentially encourages such attitudes . it ’ s fair to say that a degree of prejudice exists within everyone and therefore within every racial group . yet when it remains unchecked , it leads to attitudes that are simply unethical and should not be tolerated by those that choose to accept and ignore them .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_85940,"> paisley wants to know how he can express his southern pride . here are some ways . he could hold a huge party on martin luther king 's birthday , to celebrate a southerner 's contribution to the world of democracy . he could rock a t - shirt emblazoned with faulkner 's light in august , and celebrate the south 's immense contribution to american literature . he could preach about the contributions of unknown southern soldiers like andrew jackson smith . he could tell the world about the original cassius clay . he could insist that tennessee raise a statue to ida b. wells . 

 > every one of these people are southerners . and every one of them contributed to this great country . but to do that paisley would have to be more interested in a challenging conversation and less interested in a comforting lecture . 

 i absolutely * love * these last two paragraphs ( along with just about everything tnc writes ) . there needs to be more understanding - both among southerners like paisley , but also among northerners like myself who often denigrate the south as a backwards place - that the confederate - flag waving , dukes of hazzard aspect of southern culture is just one part of a very vibrant culture . they 've given us some great people , like the ones mentioned in the article , along with great food , music , literature , etc .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_29970,"defining privilege privilege is a scary word . it is vague . it is cumbersome . it is spoken with apprehension and avoided like the black plague . these invisible boundaries exist , pushing us from confronting our own privilege and defining what privilege means for others around us . this should not be happening . yet , i find myself guilty at times . i don ’ t recall the last time i talked about privilege with a family member , more or less a good friend . thus it remains unspoken , a voldemort-like “ he-who-must-not-be-named ” term bridging society and race . but at a time when the definition of privilege needs to find its voice , its calling in conversations more than ever , we need to curb these unconscious fears . we need to address the deaths of alton sterling and mario woods at the very root . we need to see that they are tied directly to privilege . this starts with an honest conversation , organic and raw and open . we need to detach ourselves from the reality we live in , step back , and view the world from a different lens , the lens of those who don ’ t enjoy the same luxuries and status , the privilege . how would i define privilege ? i believe the answer can be found up close and personal , to me and my experiences . i , like most people i know , are benefactors from this abstruse term called privilege . we have food to eat , a house to sleep in , a good education , and wifi to surf the web . taken for granted , these seemingly mundane “ necessities ” go easily unnoticed and unappreciated . in fact , once we have access to these needs , life without them becomes unimaginable . we make ourselves blind to the realities and never truly stop to think about the people who are missing a piece of the privilege pie . this is not a hopeful thought , but it ’ s something we can fix . this is a definition taken completely from a socioeconomic standpoint . this definition is important . however , this term called privilege , i believe , is more accurately defined when referring to race . ta-nehisi coates guided me through an introductory understanding of race and privilege after reading between the world and me . framing a rough sketch of his reality , i saw his world and opportunity constantly shaped not by his competency , but by his blackness . my realities are entirely different from his . i am able to walk down the streets unafraid and smile at the police without fearing retribution . because of my privilege , my race , the color of my skin , i can choose to stay complacent about these issues . i can say , “ this is not my responsibility . this is not of my concern. ” but , this complacency is wrong . it feels wrong . instead , it is crucial to take these feelings and reverse them into empathy and understanding . how do we act on these feelings ? when you feel like there is no where to go , no one to have a conversation with because they refuse to acknowledge privilege themselves , it ultimately starts with you and your voice . speak up . write . read . learn . educate yourself on your culture . educate yourself on people who don ’ t look the same as you . speak up . ask yourself questions . speak up . gather your own knowledge and form your own definition of privilege . teach others to do the same .",medium_antiracist

 i believe what blm is trying to say is that they recognize family structures that are not nuclear , and that they prefer to think of the village as being a foundation of support for families . in this way , a single mom and two kids , for example , can still receive the support and love they need to thrive and grow . 

 this perspective is common in african american culture and others . as the dominant power of western culture , the united states has abandoned this socialist ideal for brutal capitalism . because the economy now demands that both parents work as wage slaves in order to have a stable middle class life , those families that lack two adult wage earners are pushed into poverty and told it is their fault for having a “ broken home ” .

 an ideology , a religion , etc . does n't infuse someone with vigor and work ethic . so we toss this phrase around without parsing the words to it . but basically it was a word that promoted a white chauvinism and superiority .

 i think there is more to this than race . we have to step back and look at the full picture . there are other things at play . i think what your father says would be true even if america were all white , because the class divide is so pronounced , and has been since the inception of the constitution , where only men who owned property could vote . 

 you are not arguing that the issue is complex , rather , you are arguing that it is class that is the real culprit . 

 >   i think what your father says would be true even if america were all white , because the class divide is so pronounced 

 thus , you have reduced the issue to a single cause , a cause that is problematically framed , and demonstrably untrue .   it is problematically framed because you make this argument and it comes across as an apologia for white supremacy .   in essence you are stating that we should not blame white supremacy for a white person 's white supremacist views , instead we should look to the issue of class .   an issue that you troublingly disassociate from race .   it is demonstrably untrue that white people 's narratives about "" givers and takers "" is not about race .   this has been a dog whistle since the 1960s .   hell , it has been verified by members of the republican party that they initiated this discourse in order to demonize black people .   your drive to give the father the benifit of the doubt is not informed by a knowledge or understanding of american history . 

 your contention that i am making a straw man argument is ridiculous .

medium_antiracist_37223,"what did you just call my sector ? the social sector , i mean the charitable sector , excuse me , the third sector , wait , the plural sector , errrrh… our sector , is experiencing an existential dilemma when it comes to what we call ourselves . don ’ t get me wrong i believe in the power of language . it can bring clarity or cloud , include or exclude , build or tear down . what is troubling about our inability to come to terms with a name that identifies our sector points to a deeper , more troubling issue — our sector is searching for its identity and purpose in a society and world that has changed dramatically . many of these changes are due to societal trends , systems and issues not created by and larger than our sector . aside from these societal shifts , perhaps our sector ’ s biggest struggle comes from trying to define our identity in relationship to the public and private sector . as a black person in america , i understand the struggle of trying to define yourself in relationship to others and the challenge of claiming your identity in the midst of forces larger than you . the more i thought about my personal experiences with claiming my identity and the challenges faced by our sector in claiming its identity i noticed some remarkable similarities . in fact , i came to the realization that if all the sectors that make up our economy were a human family our sector , based on how other sectors view it , would probably be a person of color . if you doubt this conclusion here are a few quick questions we can ask to test if our sector ’ s lived experiences matches the lived experiences of people of color . if our sector ’ s answers would be , and i believe they are , yes to all three questions then our sector would definitely be a person of color . furthermore , i believe our sector would be black , but i admit that ’ s debatable . let me offer a couple words of caution . first i am in no way saying our sector ’ s identity crisis remotely compares to the ongoing systemic and institutional racism and oppression faced by people of color . although if the comparison does elicit more empathy from our sector to the plight of people of color then great . second , when you are dealing with something as complex as coming to grips with self-identify and figuring out what to or not to call yourself there are so many ways to go astray . so maybe our sector can learn from the experience of people of color who have also struggled to claim their identity and name . after all isn ’ t one of the benefits of diversity the ability to gain new perspectives and insights . here are a few lessons , mostly advice , from my family , friends and black culture that have helped me on my journey of self-discovery . i hope they help our sector in its quest to find its identity . lesson 1 : you are allowed to feel some kinda way feeling some kinda way is both a feeling and expressive phrase . it offers the opportunity to acknowledge your feelings but gives you the space and time to explore them more deeply to understand where they come from and what they mean . so the next time you hear someone say , “ why can ’ t you operate more like the other sectors ? ” or “ we keep giving you money but where is the societal impact. ” know it ’ s ok to feel some kinda way . give yourself a moment to feel the emotion and recognize that you are not just imagining that micro aggression that was just hurled at you . once you have composed yourself then you can start the hard work of figuring out what that exchange was all about and what , if anything , you are going to do about it . lesson 2 : baby , it doesn ’ t matter what they call you . it matters what you answer to . let me be clear- as a sector you will be called out of your name . there are people who either out of ignorance or intent will refer to you as one of the names listed previously . you will have a gut reaction so just refer to lesson 1 . if the offense is really egregious or if it is leveled by someone from the public or private sector remember this- you have control over how you react . no one or other sector can define you . so instead of worrying about what others call you focus on your best self and act accordingly . if you are referred to as not innovative , then go innovate ; if you are referred to as simple charity , then go invest in systemic solutions ; and if you are referred to as less than , then become more . in so doing you will define yourself . lesson 3 : don ’ t look for a fight but if they start one- finish it . another way to say this is , “ if they put their hands on you , break ’ em. ” because as a sector you should never condone violence or act violently please take this advice figuratively . there are plenty of issues giving you a black eye — scandals and abuse by bad organizations , lack of support for a raise in the minimum wage and dark money flowing into politics . in case you haven ’ t noticed you are in the middle of all these fights and you are getting pummeled . in life you are known for what you stand for and what you fight for so throw a punch for goodness sake the whole world is watching you . as a sector you didn ’ t start these fights but you should finish them . and one of the most important lessons of them all…… lesson 4 : never , ever use the “ n ” word in mixed company let ’ s face it as a sector you have a very tumultuous history with the “ n ” word . you should never and i mean never , ever use the word not-for-profit , or its derivative , nonprofit , to refer to yourself or others in mixed company . let me define mixed company because it can be confusing . there are two types of mixed company- the first consists of organizations who look like you but don ’ t really identify as like you and the second consists of the other sectors who know for a fact they are definitely not like you . the first type of mixed company consists of foundations , churches , superpacs and social enterprises and they in no way want to be associated with the “ n ” word . if you make the mistake of referring to them using the “ n ” word they will absolutely take you to task . the second type of mixed company consists of the public and private sector . they know that they are not like you and the “ n ” word does not apply to them . please refrain from using the “ n ” word to describe yourself or others like you in their presence . the last thing you want to do is give the public or private sector the idea that it is ok to use the “ n ” word because if they use the ” n ” word around the wrong group or organizations they could end up in some serious conflict . now , whether you use the “ n ” word to refer to yourself or those like you in your personal conversations is up to you . as a sector you have that right . but if you do use the “ n ” word know that if others hear you using it they can and will judge you . judging from how well the lessons above apply to our sector i ’ m thinking our sector would definitely be black . if you are a little confused and shocked that our sector is a person of color and black that ’ s a natural reaction to being seen as the other . i must admit you never really get use too it . there are way more lessons and questions to consider then the ones i have offered here . and to be honest the lessons at best are just survival and protest tools to navigate the daily challenges of life as a person of color . the true secret to maintaining your sanity as you search for self-identity and what to call yourself is to not let it consume you to the point that you miss the most valuable lesson of all — it ’ s not about how others see you but about how you see yourself . like all lessons in life this one has to be learned , mastered and relearned . if as a sector we can do this , then we are truly a step closer to finding and claiming our identity , name and power . originally published at thesignifyingnonprofit.org on february 3 , 2017 .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_28794,"i am racist ( and so is america ) two days ago brittany and i were walking through cuenca when a street dog attacked her . it got its teeth around her leg before we were able to scare it off . there was no physical harm but the event left her a little jittery . the next day i could see that she was acting more cautiously around the dogs in town . she was visibly scared . i asked her if she was okay . “ yeah i ’ m okay . i ’ m just a little shaken. ” i know how she felt because eleven years ago something similar happened to me . i was walking to a party in washington , dc . when i got jumped by a group of six or seven teenagers . they came up behind us , punched my friend in the face and pointed a gun at both of us . i dropped my wallet . they took it and ran off . the kids were black . ever since then i ’ ve acted a little more cautiously around black teens . i ’ m not proud of this . in fact , it makes my stomach turn to even write these words down . but i ’ m sharing this because i think it ’ s important to acknowledge , and i think it ’ s intellectually dishonest to deny . on that day , eleven years ago fear crept into my heart . i hate that it exists in there , and as much as i ’ ve tried to vanquish it , a tiny part of it remains . unfortunately i don ’ t think i ’ m alone in my biases . in fact , i know i am not alone . america as a whole is racist . from slavery to jim crow to the age of mass incarceration , racism has always been at the very heart of america and endorsed by our government overtly or tacitly . it is the cornerstone upon which we built the world ’ s largest economy and it is the lingering noose around our neck that will eventually bring our country down if we fail to address it . i know when i say this it makes people uncomfortable but it ’ s the truth . when i say america is racist i ’ m not talking about kkk or donald trump style racism . i ’ m talking about unconscious biases , and we all have them whether we choose to acknowledge them or not . our brand of racism today is more insidious than the racism of our past . it is baked into every institution and every facet of our society from our media to our schools to our criminal justice system . it ’ s all around us . it ’ s everywhere . the sooner we are honest about our own biases and the role we play in perpetuating this racial caste the sooner we can do something about it . on the surface we all say we are against racism and racist policies , but we witness the same horrific incidences over and over and nothing seems to ever change . why are we so impotent ? what is getting in the way of change ? well , for one there are the racism deniers . despite all the overwhelming evidence of institutionalized racism , there are people who want to pretend that racism is a thing of the past . i ’ m not talking about fringe groups of people wearing “ make america great again ” hats . i ’ m talking about everyday , normal people . they are our friends , our family , our elected officials , our ceos , our church leaders , our media pundits , our judges and our jurors . they are all around us . these are the people that will find every plausible reason to explain away nearly every police shooting as justified . these are the people who think there is nothing unusual with the fact that whites and blacks use drugs at the same rate yet blacks are ten times more likely to be sent to jail for drug offenses . these are the people who fool themselves into thinking that success in life has everything to do with hard work and nothing to do with the privilege you are born into . perhaps you know people like this . or perhaps this is you . in the days of slavery , slaveholders would deny that the institution of slavery was amoral . they would explain it away in myriad ways that seemed perfectly reasonable at the time but today , of course seems totally ludicrous . the people that deny that racism exists today are no different than the slaveholders of the past . their arguments at times may sound reasonable but there is no doubt history will judge these folks as harshly as history has judged the slaveholders of the past . the racism deniers , however , are not actually the biggest obstacle to fixing america ’ s racism problem . the biggest obstacle to progress is the person who doesn ’ t realize she is part of the problem . she probably has some racial biases just like everyone else but she is not outwardly racist . she likely considers herself progressive and feels genuine sadness every time she sees a new shooting on the news . yet , for whatever reason she chooses to sit on the sidelines . as we ’ ve seen over this past week with the heartbreaking violence in baton rouge , minnesota , and dallas things have not gotten any better since ferguson . arguably they have gotten worse . people are still dying needlessly . there is no end in sight . there comes a point where we no longer have a right to sit on the sidelines with a clear concisous . there comes a point where we have an obligation to act . because at the end of the day , it ’ s not the activists who are going to fix this problem . the activists can spark a flame but you need more than a spark to create change . it ’ s the sideline sitters who are going to have to fix this . because it ’ s the sideline sitters who make up the great majority of america and when this group wakes up and decides enough is enough that ’ s when this mess we are in finally ends .",medium_antiracist

 my question to those people then is this : how do you propose to make this happen ? racism is an ongoing , lifelong thing for many people , which obviously divides . how do you want to expel racism by acting as if race is not important ? 

 if you want to dispel their rhetoric , you have to give reasons as to why you do n't think their line of thought is correct or question their line of thought until they come upon their own hypocrisy , which is not necessarily an easy thing to do , but my answer : trying to take a colorblind approach is idealistic and does not work in our society because it ignores race , which is not easy for people of color to do as race can be and is a huge identifying factor that permeates many parts of our life and daily existence .

 attempting to relieve people 's woes , clean the environment , and combat injustices through unsanctioned channels is castigated and lambasted as treachery against the state . you ca n't even pick up a piece of trash without provoking a fellow neighbor ( making a fuss over his property ) or a park ranger , unless you 're with community service , unless you 're one of them . we are expected to mourn for people in their plight and show our "" solidarity "" with them , but we 're just really watching and standing by helplessly , being thrown to and fro by current events .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_28441,"‘ stay woke ’ if you follow me on twitter and checked your timeline this morning you may have noticed a number of retweets from me regarding the death of another black man — alton sterling . i happened to be on the treadmill in the gym when i came across the story myself . i didn ’ t want to watch the video but i did , and it upset me . so i wanted everyone that follows me to know what had happened , particularly because i feel some are so far removed from these incidents that they never even find out when they occur , or worse , they do but it doesn ’ t really bother them . from what has been reported so far , it seems he was standing in front of a store selling cds . he wasn ’ t armed , he didn ’ t resist arrest ( he was taken down so quickly he didn ’ t really get a chance to ) , and then he was shot 5 times whilst pinned to the ground . the two policemen who shot him both claim that at the time the incident took place their body cams fell off and so didn ’ t capture what happened ( * rolls eyes * ) . i watched a documentary recently called oj : made in america . if you haven ’ t seen it check it out , it ’ s a real eye-opener . the first episode is almost exclusively dedicated to charting his successful football career . i feel this is deliberately done to show how loved and embraced oj was within the mostly white community in which he lived , and also show the extent of his fall from grace . the documentary also gives an insight into what the rest of black america were experiencing at the time : police brutality and racism . remember rodney king ? that happened in 1991 . just 13 days after the rodney king incident , a 15-year-old black girl named latasha harlins was shot in the back of the head in a grocery store . the korean woman named soon ja du , thought she was attempting to steal orange juice , when in fact latasha had money in her hand and brought both the orange juice and the money to the counter to pay . after a short scuffle , the woman took out a handgun from under the counter as latasha was walking away , shooting her in the back of the head and killing her instantly . what do you think happened to soon ja du ? you ’ d think that she would be found guilty of 1st degree murder and be sentenced to life without parole right ? wrong . she was found guilty of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and given a $ 500 dollar fine , put on 5 years probation , and asked to carry out 400 hours of community service . that is the value the system puts on black life , this is what angers and frustrates black people — that they can be murdered in cold blood and that it won ’ t mean a thing . this is why black people say ‘ black lives matter ’ , we want it to matter . we want our lives to be given the same value as everyone else . fast forward 4 years later to 1995 , the beginning of the oj trial . according to one of the jurors who appeared on the documentary , many of the jury on the case ( most of whom were black ) gave a not-guilty verdict as ‘ payback ’ for what happened to rodney king . it is a shocking admission , and i ’ m surprised no action has been taken against them for failing to carry out their judicial duties properly . but it just shows the extent of the hurt black people in america feel at the way they have been treated through the years . don ’ t be surprised if rioting occurs in baton rouge , the city where alton was murdered . if it doesn ’ t happen in the next few days it may happen if and when the policemen are acquitted . you might be wondering why people would riot and loot their own community ? after all , this is where they live , these are their streets and their local stores , why would they burning them down ? it might not make sense to you , but even though i have never rioted or looted myself , i can understand why people do . have you ever been so angry and frustrated that you wanted to smash a glass or throw your phone at the tv ? that ’ s your phone and your tv that you ’ d be smashing , but you ’ re so worked up that you don ’ t care . imagine that anger and frustration multiplied by a thousand . that ’ s how black people in america have felt for decades . each time they see a black person killed by the police that hurt , anger , and frustration deepens . there were riots in la shortly after the rodney king and latasha harlins incidents , and there have been many since . martin luther king once said “ injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere ” . this couldn ’ t be more true right now . you don ’ t have to be black or living in america to care about what is happening there . these are people being murdered . they are sons , fathers , and brothers . if these incidents aren ’ t familiar to you , please take some time to look them up . as some would put it , “ stay woke ” . rip alton sterling .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_3795,"steve , let me break this down for you because you clearly are not getting it at all . our struggle has been historically different , the difference is black people actually assemble and take charge and build power within their communities to enact change through government . asian-americans fail at doing this and when it comes to social issues they rarely have a voice because they choose to abstain from having said voice . this is not the fault of black people , but an effect of the asian community ’ s own actions , or lack there of i should say . it doesn ’ t matter if it was an accident , akai gurley is still dead . there is nothing that can happen to peter liang ( ass rape ) that will trump what happened to akai gurley because death is permanent and superior to all worldly consequences . he ’ s still breathing . he can still talk to his family , he can still hug and hold his parents , he still has a life . if you knew about african-american history you would know that black liberation and civil rights has always been about getting equality for black people due to the way we are treated by white america . for your people to protest with signs for the murderer ( yes , murderer because that ’ s what you are when you kill someone , accidental or not . ) is irony at it ’ s finest . you do not have the experience the black community does to organize an actual protest , and i ’ m not just talking about the fact you used a sheep on the “ scapegoat ” signs . asian-americans don ’ t know how to talk about injustice in an effective way because your community has spent more time buying into the model minority myth than trying to change the way you ’ re treated via protests . you were aware white cops were getting off killing unarmed black men but felt no need to assert yourself into the conversation until the cop who killed said unarmed black man was asian-american . that ’ s pitiful and racist . your next comment is so unapologetically racist i almost don ’ t want to respond but i ’ m going to . regardless of whether or not he texted his union rep , he still bickered with his partner for 6+ minutes instead of calling emergency medical services and stepped over akai gurley while he bled out . for you to bring up “ he sold crack and had a baby mama ! ” is your anti-black racism showing . he wasn ’ t selling crack that night , and even if he was he still didn ’ t deserve to be shot over it . that ’ s ludicrous . you ’ re devaluing his life because you don ’ t view his life as valuable as peter ’ s because you don ’ t view black people as honorable members of society . i ’ m very aware of what a stray bullet is , it does not mean someone does not deserve to pay for a crime . if i shot a gun at a wall and it ricocheted off and killed you i would still deserve to go to jail because even though i didn ’ t intentionally point my gun at you , i still shot it off when i shouldn ’ t have had it out because i was just “ inspecting ” an apartment complex , and you would still be dead . nobody in the black lives matter movement has tried to demonize peter liang ’ s character by saying he sold drugs , he was a member of the chinese mafia , he had problems in school as a kid or any other bs . black lives matter has focused first and foremost on getting justice for akai gurley ’ s family and seeing the man who killed him is brought to justice , as they ’ ve been advocating for every time it was a white cop . now , you seem confused . black lives matter always showed it ’ s “ true ” color , it says it in the title . black lives matter , nobody hid that . during the 60s and 70s when the black panther party was active it was black power . not minority power or minority lives matter . we emphasized black because we look out for ourselves and build our communities and networks to get justice in cases like this and hopefully prevent them from happening altogether . if you ’ re upset at black people for starting a movement to highlight the importance of their lives being stolen by police officers who remain on active duty , that ’ s sad . black americans have been fighting for justice and equality for 400+ years , and mlk paved the way for many asian-americans to get where they are today . if anything , you should be grateful of how resilient we are . if “ yellow ” cared about “ black ” 10,000 chinese-americans would ’ ve come out when eric garner was killed by nypd . to say black lives matter is about a payday is absolutely ridiculous . where have black lives matter protestors asked for money ? we would take a conviction over a settlement any day . money is not a consolation prize for losing a loved one , nor will it ever reverse the effects of what happened . seeing how you obviously have some internalized hatred of black people , i ’ m going to direct you to some articles written by other asian-americans with the hopes that you might listen to them . they ’ re saying exactly the same thing i am , because they understand black lives matter is not about demonizing peter liang , but getting justice for yet another unarmed black man being killed by a racist institution that over policies black community that causes situations like this . steve , the next time you tell yourself “ black steps on yellow ” , look at how the asian community comes out in support of someone who killed a black man . look at your “ crack dealer baby mama drama ” comments . then ask yourself , who ’ s really stepping on who here ?

medium_antiracist_34362,"the state will not save us from gender violence or why did white women vote for donald trump ? i was at a rally in oklahoma city to protest police officer daniel holtzclaw who had raped several black women . during the protest , many had signs that said holtzclaw should get life in prison because that would be “ justice. ” i was disturbed by this demand because the prison industrial complex is itself oppressive and thus can not bring about justice . of course holtzclaw ’ s survivors should have justice , but why do we equate justice with the criminal justice system ? what was also noteworthy is that only racial justice organizations supported the black women who had been raped by holtzclaw . white feminist and anti-violence organizations refused to become involved . i thought that was strange . but my aunt explained to me that anti-violence organizations generally do not support survivors of violence who have been criminalized because these organizations work so closely with prosecutors and police officers as their primary strategy for addressing violence . bell hooks discusses the importance of feminist politics for everyone . she notes that is important to address the connections between race and gender . she also talks about the importance of addressing gender violence . but she does not address the intersections of race and gender . hooks argues that domestic violence is the result of male dominance . it is also important to recognize domestic violence as the result of racial dominance . slavery , lynching , native genocide , war , etc were all perpetuated through sexual violence . thus , it is problematic to use racist institutions ( i.e . the prison system ) to solve the problem of sexual and domestic violence , especially for women of color because doing so just normalizes the racism of these institutions . this is a contradictory strategy that does not create safety . for instance , when mandatory arrest laws were passed so that police had to arrest someone in a domestic violence case , batterers starting calling the police first . the net result of these laws that were supposed to protect survivors is that the mortality rate of black survivors of domestic violence has increased by 98 % . the problem with this strategy is further seen in anne elizabeth moore ’ s exposé of anti-trafficking organizations . these organizations are there to “ save ” trafficked women . but they are essentially operating as “ paramilitary ” organizations that often make things worse for women . as the world health organization notes , sex workers are put in more danger rather than more safe from these rescue operations because they are most victimized by the police , particularly during these operations . jyoti sanghera notes , this strategy presumes that law enforcement is “ neutral and unproblematic. ” in fact , when the state gets involved in trafficking it ends up criminalizing sex workers that are not trafficking . and states often equate migration with trafficking . thus trafficking gets used to crackdown on immigration . obviously , anti-immigration laws are very harmful for immigrant survivors of domestic violence who may risk deportation if they try to escape their abusers . so the problem is that the state promises that it can use state violence to somehow solve the problem of gender violence . this promised is not questioned . as hooks notes , white women are often more invested in maintaining white privilege than stopping sexism . thus , we can see perhaps why white women voted for donald trump , despite trump being an admitted sexual predator . he promises white women safety from “ terrorist ” threats and his promise erases the gender violence he promotes in the minds of many white women . we accept the idea that the state can protect us from violence that we do not see the violence perpetuated by the state . trump thus becomes someone who can stop violence rather than someone who perpetuates violence , particularly racial and gender violence . bell hooks does link domestic violence to militarism . she states that when we condone military violence , we train men to be “ killers , ” and the violence they perpetuate will not remain on the battleground . given that the state is also a racial state , then anti-violence strategies that rely on the state will also perpetuate racism . thus , for there to be true liberation , we need strategies that address gender violence and state violence at the same time .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_19041,"on an anti-racist national park service on its surface the national park appears to be an almost post-racial utopia . collective resources are pooled to preserve an unimaginable diversity of natural and historical resources , which are made available for the enjoyment of any person . the national parks , for better or worse , tell the story of america . the incredible feat of their preservation is only one side of the coin , the other is the cleansing of indigenous people from these same lands . this is the parks ’ original sin . the very purity national parks are so lauded for is the direct result of the cleansing of native people from these lands . like america , the national parks are a colonial project . still , in them we can recognize something good . in the darkness of their story , a great light shines through — the undeniable beauty , and deep sense of belonging we feel in these places . how do we redeem national parks and repair the original sin of their creation ? we must look to create an anti-racist national park service . what does an anti-racist national park service look like ? to make an anti-racist national park service we must build diversity and suffocate discrimination by forging worker power . we must demilitarize park police , and focus on resource protection through education . we must deny the fetishization of national parks as the epitome of wilderness . finally , we must make reparations to the indigenous people of these lands . the national park service is built on the precarity of its workers . the overwhelming majority of the workforce is seasonal . the national park service is disproportionately white . these are not unrelated facts . the park service workforce is kept underpaid , in substandard housing , forced to move frequently , and easy to dispose of . thus , the national park worker is economically unstable . when a job does not reliably provide enough to survive on , most people who pursue it will be those who have something to fall back on , that is , those who come from some level of generational wealth . home ownership is the way that most american families build generational wealth . because of policies like redlining , which is still happening , this is a possibility mostly only for white people . we are told that we are paid in sunsets . this is unacceptable . do not be tricked into thinking that simply because your job is inherently valuable to you , that you should not be fairly compensated for it . by unionizing the workforce , and collectively negotiating for fair compensation , we can create a park service which welcomes people of all backgrounds — people with heavy burdens of student loans , those who must send home money to support their families , those with chronic medical conditions , and those without a parent ’ s house to return to at the end of the season . worker power is a prerequisite for a diverse workforce . no amount of diversity training or seminars will matter if people simply can not afford to take the job . at the heart of the park service is a culture of homogeny . we must replace this uniformity with solidarity . to welcome diversity to our workforce we must dismantle the image of the white ranger . maintaining high standards for the appearance of uniforms is a part of a professional uniformed service . but the current uniform standards can too easily be construed to require a cis white appearance . roll back the antiquated rules against men wearing earrings , tattoos , and hair and jewelry styles popular among non-white people . the visage of the white ranger stands guard against the workforce of the future . the precarity of the seasonal workforce quiets dissent . every six months the seasonal worker is thrown from his or her job , and asked to apply again . knowing how easy it is to be replaced by the long list of fresh undergraduate applicants , the savvy seasonal keeps their mouth shut . discrimination and abuse festers in our silence . by ending the precarity we can finally end the silence . too many times we have heard coworkers complain about an asian visitor , heard people perpetuate stereotypes against indigenous colleagues , or witnessed sexual harassment and discrimination from visitors and superiors . what did we say ? without the implicit threat of revoked re-hire hanging over people ’ s heads , they will be liberated to speak out against discrimination . we must demilitarize park police . there is an abundance of resources about the issues with militarized law enforcement in this country . most of these apply equally to park police . i won ’ t go on at length with regard to this issue because in its generalized form it has been written about by many who are much more qualified than me to speak about it . seek those resources out . i want to focus on things specific to the park service . this issue can be sticky because many employees work closely with park law enforcement , and share with them a mission : conserving the resources of the park . resource preservation requires an element of policing — this is an undeniable fact . but as much as possible this policing should be educational rather than punitive . as undeniable as the necessity of resource protection is the fact that park police have committed abuses and acted outside the scope of this mission . make sure you ’ re on the right side of that line . we must contest the fetishization of national park wilderness . what does this mean and how does it relate to anti-racism ? by lauding the national parks as exemplars of natural purity , one implicitly degrades other types of nature . objectively , a dandelion growing through the crack of a sidewalk , or a tree growing in a highway median is no more or less nature than a national park . it is only in our perception and constructed meanings of these things that they differ . because the dandelion and the median plants are seen as degraded and lesser forms of nature , they are easier to remove . these devalued places are overwhelmingly where toxic waste , industrial pollutants , and contaminated dreck are dumped . these places are also overwhelmingly proximate to communities of color , marginalized by decades of careful planning and segregation at the hands of white people . the fetishization of national park wilderness creates the psychological premise for the poisoning of black communities . finally , we must address the original sin of the national park — the expulsion of indigenous people . indigenous people must be given reparations in the form of money , a portion of the economic boon that a national park represents to a region . a tax should be levied on tourist-serving businesses in the vicinity of national parks , with a stipend paid out to members of every tribe historically or currently associated with the area . places must be restored to their indigenous names to expunge the specious narrative of the white discoverer . indigenous people must be given a seat on the board . above the superintendent should sit a “ board of directors , ” made up of workers , scientists , and tribal members . in this way power can be restored to the proper hands . these steps are only a start . we must continue to fight against racism in the park service , and make these resources truly accessible to everyone . we must use this worker power to fight for the elimination of fees , for proper funding of parks , and battle against the creeping specter of development and privatization in public lands . we must look for ways to repair the painful scars of segregation in national parks , and obliterate a political economy focused on growth at the expense of the planet . in this way we can take steps towards making the utopian ideal of the national parks a reality , and begin to make amends for the genocidal origins of america ’ s best idea .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_9474,"education ’ s diversity dilemma : what can be done my 18 years as a public high school teacher and current 15 years as a university professor have one dilemma in common : diversity . at the k-12 level , many schools struggle to recruit and maintain a diverse faculty ; while universities often face a lack of diversity in both faculty and students . the teaching staff at the rural south carolina school where i taught was nearly all white , working-class , and essentially all christian . once we hired an outstanding woman to teach science ; she happened to be a native of india and hindu . the culture in the school was so toxic to her diversity , that she left — or better phrased , she was run off by the implicit and direct messages of the people and the culture of the school . my university has recently confronted the low percentage of women faculty as well as concerns about faulty and student diversity . at our opening faculty retreat focusing on diversity and inclusion , a female faculty member expressed concern over the time and energy needed to address pronoun preferences to be sensitive to gender identity and/or gender expression . concurrently , several faculty expressed surprise that complimenting black faculty or students for being “ articulate ” is racist and offensive . more pervasive , however , was the demand that we not proceed with diversity initiatives without defining diversity , and that always included concerns about reducing diversity to race . both of these strategies bound to the norms of academia , in effect , marginalize the power of privilege ( many whites have been and are hired because they are white ) and the realities of race in the diversity dilemma . parallel to these strategies were responses to a gender study at our university , a study that was refuted by several white male faculty because it didn ’ t ( in their view ) meet the standards of high-quality research — too much anecdote , and thus , a code for too many voices from those affected , from those normally without a voice . all of these situations point to the toxic nature of centered communities that derive from both individual and systemic forces — even when many or most of the people consider themselves not bigoted , racist , classist , homophobic , or sexist . individuals often embody and express bigotry despite their own intentions not to be bigoted or intolerant due to a lack of critical consciousness , and thus , as lack of critical sensitivity . over the decades from when i graduated high school and through my career teaching at the school , the community saw a significant decrease in blacks , resulting in a relatively white community . the faculty of the schools stayed almost entirely white — even as schools sought more teachers of color . my current university has worked diligently — as have many universities — to increase student and faculty diversity , with little to show for all the effort . this is the diversity dilemma that remains — and may be nearly impossible to correct . therefore , many diversity and inclusion initiatives become bogged down in and/or eventually abandon diversity efforts because of inadequate outcomes related to goals . the failure to increase diversity of faculty , for example , may be a lack of political will — as maybeth gasman argues : but one missing component of diversity and inclusion initiatives is certain : working toward culturally relevant communities that acknowledge the sensitivity and privilege afforded centered people , that work to spread that sensitivity to all members of the community , and that decrease and erase the privilege afforded centered people . “ culturally relevant , ” as envisioned by gloria ladson-billings [ 1 ] , in educational communities must foster awareness and sensitivity to culture and race as well as to gender , sexuality , social class , and religion — among faculty , staff , and students . in schools and colleges , the question is not if we have the time and energy to address pronoun preferences to be sensitive to transgender people , but how we can assure that all members of the community are educated on the power of gendered language to center and oppress people . for example , schools and universities can adopt “ they ” as a singular gender-neutral pronoun as a simple policy move , but also infuse the gender politics of language throughout the curriculum and in faculty development . the paradox of course is multi-layered : education has a diversity dilemma that quite possibly can not be addressed well directly , but may be ameliorated by education itself , education that is purposefully culturally relevant and systemic . diversifying a toxic community is unlikely to be as effective as creating an inclusive community that invites diversity . diversity initiatives that fail to realize that the latter can and must be done are making a regrettable mistake that may jeopardize the best of intentions of all involved . [ 1 ] see her definition : while giving a talk about minority serving institutions at a recent higher education forum , i was asked a question pertaining to the lack of faculty of color at many majority institutions , especially more elite institutions.my response was frank : “ the reason we don ’ t have more faculty of color among college faculty is that we don ’ t want them . we simply don ’ t want them. ” those in the audience were surprised by my candor and gave me a round of applause for the honesty . i have defined culturally relevant teaching as a pedagogy of opposition ( 1992c ) not unlike critical pedagogy but specifically committed to collective , not merely individual , empowerment .",medium_antiracist

sit-in conducted in princeton university president christopher eisgruber ’ s office in nassau hall on november 18 , 2015 . this demonstration was a culmination of efforts spanning the course of the past year by the black justice league to induce action on the part of the university to address and redress institutional failings in creating a safe and inclusive campus for black students . this letter is intended to address troubling elements of the discourse we have seen at princeton and to clarify any misconceptions around the demands made : a critical rethinking of woodrow wilson ’ s legacy at princeton , a diversity distribution requirement for students and compulsory competency training for faculty and staff , and affinity housing and space for black students . detractors have claimed that protests on campus have stifled ‘ civil discourse ’ and that protesters have unreasonably resorted to ‘ extreme ’ tactics in a manner that has left others unwilling to openly express their opinions for fear of intimidation , despite the apparent availability of open mechanisms through which to express grievances . as various interlocutors have highlighted , the actions and demands of bjl have opened up greater dialogue on a topic around which there was very little speech — and what speech there was , was in fact , narrow in scope and fundamentally dishonest . these critiques should be recognized as what they are : baseless claims made in an attempt to tone-police and ultimately to silence those whose voices have historically been repressed . demanding that marginalized people present their concerns in a way that is most palatable to those who are responsible for addressing their grievances not only reveals a profound lack of historical understanding around the purpose of and conditions under which civil disobedience is employed , but it also maintains the oppressive status quo by placing the burden back on those marginalized to prove themselves worthy of being heard . by tone-policing and endorsing respectability politics , those within dominant groups move attention away from the real and substantive issues raised . simultaneously , this serves to obfuscate the oppressive environment that precipitates such ‘ drastic ’ action by hyperscrutinizing the reactions and responses of the marginalized . another important subject concerns the operationalization of free speech . first , as public intellectuals of this subject have remarked , making tone-deaf appeals to the abstract and universally valued principle of free speech devoid of historical context and power analysis is often a tactic of derailment . this tactic is one that purposefully steers away from critical conversations around racism in order to maintain the racist status quo . nevertheless , we think it is important to express our commitment to free speech yet caution against what we see as a persistent conflation of racially offensive and hostile speech with civil discourse . freedom of speech is a mark of civil life and should be vigorously defended . however , if freedom of speech is defined as the ability to vilify , erase , and belittle , particularly , the historically marginalized , this definition does not align itself with the noble ideal of civility . discourse that is dehumanizing , is , by definition , no longer civil . it is also crucial that we do not intellectualize this discussion to the extent that it becomes wholly divorced from the lived experiences of students who are personally impacted by instances of racial violence , both in speech and action . the vast majority of university students are required to eat , sleep and socialize on campus . these campuses become our homes . with this in mind , the mental , emotional , and physical well-being of students must be of principal concern to the broader community and to those tasked with ensuring the safety and welfare of students . if princeton university is the progressive institution it claims to be , it must make clear that racially charged rhetoric and conduct is not only antithetical to its mission , but that it also has no place at any rigorous academic institution , particularly in one that prides itself on producing influential intellectuals . all this to say , the black justice league does not stand in opposition to the principle of free speech . in fact , we are extremely conscious of the fact that freedom of expression and association made possible the actions of november 18th and are significant vehicles through which we will propel meaningful change on this campus . what we challenge is the consistent deployment of free speech as justification for the marginalization of others . this not only severely distorts the issues , but lacks critical consideration of how that principle and its contemporary application is complicated by this nation ’ s fraught past and present : de jure racial exclusion from this nation ’ s institutions and police suppression of current # blacklivesmatter protests , for instance . rather , we envision a campus in which norms of mutual respect and understanding are fostered in conjunction with principles of free speech ; a campus where the humanity of certain segments of the population is not under constant attack and where a re-evaluation of the institutions that produce these hostile experiences are debated rather than the lived experiences themselves . this brings us to the discussion surrounding our demands . on woodrow wilson , avid defenders insist that not only was wilson ’ s racism peripheral to his other , more progressive endeavors , but also that we must honor these valuable contributions in the present moment , thus overlooking his fundamental flaws . as a result of our actions , it has become clear that woodrow wilson was virulently racist , even by historical standards . what ’ s more , he institutionalized his racism . this racism was at the core of his policies both here at princeton and as president of the united states . woodrow wilson discouraged the admission of black students to princeton , opposed black suffrage , was an ardent kkk apologist , and re-segregated federal offices that had previously been integrated — costing many black individuals and families their livelihoods and welfare . in addition , his racism was not restricted to u.s. borders , as his imperialist foreign policies detail . his racial animus was manifested in the invasion and occupation of haiti as well as in the blockage of the passage of a racial equality proposal presented by japan in 1919 that guaranteed equal treatment as one of the principles of the league of nations . it is extremely alarming that nowhere on this campus is this violent history acknowledged . instead , the narrative princeton has constructed around woodrow wilson is entirely celebratory and wholly dishonest . relatedly , another fraudulent critique is that the removal of his name would amount to an erasure of the past . we would counter that the university ’ s account of woodrow wilson is an egregious display of historical revisionism and the deliberate lack of acknowledgment of this racist legacy is erasure itself . our actions have played a pivotal role in the critical task of educating not only the princeton community , but the world at large and have also made explicit the importance of truth-telling . we believe an honest understanding of our past allows us to better shape our future and thus we do not want woodrow wilson ’ s history erased . as such , we have demanded that the university not just remove his name but also take responsibility for its history by formally recognizing woodrow wilson ’ s racist legacy in perpetuity , either with a plaque or with a web page . ultimately , to continue to honor such a man in the present manner is to spit in the face of students whose presence on this campus woodrow wilson would have abhorred . it belies the university ’ s purported commitment to inclusion and progress and reveals the university ’ s priorities to be that of maintaining the racist status quo over the safety of its students . the struggle against emblems of racism and white supremacy is global ; students at universities nationwide , such as georgetown , yale , brown , and duke have expressed similar concern with those venerated on their campuses . in south africa and at oxford , students have organized under the banner of # rhodesmustfall to demand the removal of monuments honoring john cecil rhodes , an unapologetic racist . this is an opportunity for princeton to act not only in accordance with its peer institutions who are already taking corrective action but to take the lead in a momentous and unprecedented way . many will suggest that university action on this demand will set a precedent that will ultimately lead us down a slippery slope . this misunderstands our demands and underestimates the centrality of woodrow wilson to life at princeton . we are not simply demanding the removal of the name of a ‘ flawed ’ individual ; woodrow wilson was much more than that . his racism was made evident in his policies that were often life-altering , as was the case for john abraham davis , a “ black midlevel manager in the government printing office , with 30 years ’ experience ” and who was “ by the end of wilson ’ s first term , a broken man. ” we are demanding that the university seriously contend with its troubled racial history — which includes a period in which woodrow wilson stated , “ the whole temper and tradition of the place [ princeton ] is such that no negro has ever applied for admission , and it seems unlikely that the question will ever assume practical form , ” — and make amends that reflect its purported mission and commitments , which should starkly contrast woodrow wilson ’ s . there are also other ways to commemorate wilson ’ s legacy — both the good and the bad , which the university has failed to do — without naming a dining hall , a residential college , and a public policy school after him . in regards to our proposal for an amendment to education requirements , opponents claim that such a stipulation would politicize the university . not only is this claim not borne out empirically — given that such requirements exist at other peer institutions and others such as the university of pennsylvania as well as across the university of california system — it reveals a lack of understanding of the demands made . the demands do not require that students take one particular course nor does it specify , beyond broad thematic areas , what the content of those courses should be . the proposal contains a wide range of classes and seeks to develop students ’ ability to critically examine issues of diversity as well as historical and social norms and systems of power and inequality . this proposal is an amendment , rather than an addition , to the current social analysis ( sa ) distribution requirement , ensuring that one of the two sa classes allows students to critically examine issues of diversity and marginalization . this amendment to the curriculum will not stifle academic exploration any more than the other distribution requirements . in a rapidly diversifying and globalizing society , part of a university ’ s charge is equipping students for life in a multicultural world . being able to understand the experiences and perspectives of others is an essential skill both in the workplace and as productive members of society . if princeton seeks to cultivate students who are “ in the nation ’ s service and in the service of all nations , ” these students must be able to engage with the realities of the different peoples that exist in these nations . in a similar vein , requiring cultural competency training for faculty is not imposing a particular doctrine onto princeton ’ s faculty . instead , it opens the door for a multitude of perspectives and ideas . cultural competence requires a recognition of one ’ s own cultural identity and approach to difference as well as the capacity to learn about and integrate the cultural backgrounds of one ’ s students in one ’ s pedagogy . cultural competency training is crucial in equipping educators to promote an educational setting that is conducive to success for all students , which many princeton educators fail to provide . members of the student body have expressed feelings of emotional and psychological harm as well as overall feelings of unsafety in interactions that they have had with professors , preceptors , and administrators as a result of offensive and racist behavior often stemming from ignorance and a lack of understanding . the university must actively work to address this at both a macro- and micro-level . while the council of the princeton university ( cpuc ) task force released recommendations that sought to address these issues on a micro-level , the university must work towards substantial initiatives that would affect the entire faculty . comprehensive cultural competency training would significantly improve interactions between students , faculty , and preceptors across all departments . educators with the knowledge and the tools to appreciate and engage with diversity among students will facilitate a learning environment intended to serve all students . with regards to affinity housing and space dedicated to specific cultural groups , the black justice league believes that it is of the utmost importance to provide spaces dedicated solely to marginalized groups . it is not simply about students being “ safe ” from having their values challenged , as attending a liberal arts institution should encourage every student to question their deepest convictions . it is about having a refuge from a campus — and a society — that is at best , apathetic , and at worst , hostile to the issues that black students face . it is about having a place where black students can have dignity and comfort and engage in self-healing with those who have had similar experiences and who care just as deeply about issues that plague their community . it is important for marginalized groups to have spaces where they are not constantly being pushed to assimilate into the dominant community by hiding important aspects of their identity . our peer institutions see the importance of these spaces because they realize that they help facilitate community-building and improve the overall well-being of select demographics , which in turn improves the overall well-being of the university . even princeton , in its past history , provided such a space , known as the “ third world center ” and it is this space that many black alumni note was pivotal to their princeton experience . those who denounce the notion of safe spaces are often those for whom safety is a fact of life by virtue of the privileges they have based on the identities they inhabit . conversely , nowhere in the world is truly safe for black bodies , but affording affinity spaces can provide some respite , albeit fleeting , from the harsh realities of living in an anti-black world . finally , the black justice league would like to address the discussion surrounding our decision to hold a sit-in the president ’ s office in order to have our demands properly addressed . let ’ s be clear : the black justice league has been employing official channels of advocacy embedded in the university bureaucratic structure for the past year . the black justice league formed in november 2014 and has since met with the following key administrators and administrative bodies , many of them on a recurring basis : in addition , it is through our activism that the cpuc special task force on diversity , equity , and inclusion was created and a number of initiatives launched . members of the black justice league , in conjunction with other students , faculty , and staff , served on each committee of the task force and , thus , met with even more administrators on a bi-weekly basis . we have exercised all of these bureaucratic channels frequently and consistently , only to be told that we needed to convince administrators of the marginalization that black students faced on this campus . consequently , conversation after conversation was initiated under the guise of improving marginalized students ’ experiences . conversation has always been our primary form of communication . and while we have accomplished quite a few major feats over the past year , the university has remained stagnant or recalcitrant on a number of significant concerns raised by the bjl . at an institution designed to resist change , when certain strategies no longer proved fruitful , it was imperative that we adapt accordingly and adopt new tactics that would apply increased pressure on the university . hence , the actions of november 18th . in an article in the progressive , dr. martin luther king jr. said of the 1960s civil rights sit-ins initiated by black college students , “ an electrifying movement of negro students has shattered the placid surface of campuses and communities… ” the same can be said of the present moment . across the nation , black college students are organizing and holding their institutions accountable , forcing them to reckon with their racially fraught past and present and demanding that they do better and be better for their black students . like the movements of the past , the actions of black students today have been met with mixed reactions . ultimately , however , time and justice put those students on the right side of history , and we too , believe , that we will be vindicated by history and justice . we hope that the princeton community will join us and truly work towards a more inclusive and equitable campus . black justice league",medium_antiracist

 i ’m a brown latinx and lived in finland recently , and it is the second most racist country in europe . i ’m not exactly white passing and did n’t feel uncomfortable , everyone was super nice , like really nice , but then you hear about nazi rallies in the middle of town , or certain towns where some guy told me his family / friends are a bunch of skinheads . so ... i mean there ’s no prison - industrial complex so i did n’t hear of black men getting persecuted or anyone really , by police . but that might have been just my limited experience , and also police is n’t an institution built on slavery like it is in the us , and i only ever saw a handful of cops . 

 i did feel really subtle stuff but never explicitly related to my race . just certain people treating me some type of way and i ’ve never been less popular on tinder ( damn i mean i usually am pretty popular , and that was a very long dry spell , lmao , and me and my brown friends had similar experiences ) . one crazy dude screamed at me and my friend in public once in helsinki but i do n’t speak finnish so idk what he was saying . pretty sure it was a racist tirade . there ’s a lot of colorblindness . i think the biggest problem is that poc and especially bipoc do n’t make it to positions of power in government or academic institution , so they ’re less likely to write about it and society just is n’t aware of it . 

 i ’ve lived in switzerland and that was cool , but it felt weird . sort of like getout weird because everyone again is super nice but then you hear of a muslim guy being attacked with a chainsaw and nationalist parties having anti - muslim banners over buses .... 

 all in all , i would agree with people saying here that there is more racism in some ways worse than the us , it ’s just different . sweden is way more diverse and open than finland ( something like 40 % of the population is foreign in stockholm ) . again , i was definitely treated some type of way at the club , and it was only once i told them i was american that they let me in . lmao . american trumps being poc in foreign places , there ’s definitely a difference . especially americans with money .",reddit_antiracist

 we build a space that affirms black women and is free from sexism , misogyny , and environments in which men are centered . 

 we practice empathy . we engage comrades with the intent to learn about and connect with their contexts . 

 we make our spaces family - friendly and enable parents to fully participate with their children . we dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work “ double shifts ” so that they can mother in private even as they participate in public justice work . 

 we disrupt the western - prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “ villages ” that collectively care for one another , especially our children , to the degree that mothers , parents , and children are comfortable .

reddit_antiracist_71454,"to reply to both ; 

 what questions did i not answer , i feel i was pretty direct in responding to almost everything you said , other than the end . 

 how are white people being persecuted ? 

 i honestly do n't understand what movie you are talking about with colonizers and rapists ... 

 can i get a source for your harvard study ?   yes it happens more often to white people . because there are more white people .   but it happens to a larger percentage of black people . 

 also , a big point in black lives matter is that they are not fearful of being accused of brutality because often there are no consequences . ( not everyone has gotten away with it , but it 's a lot ) . 

 you were not trying to one - up anyone .   the original poster whose account is deleted was .   i did n't realize i was talking to a different account . so sorry for that assumption .   the point was people like op try to one - up to make it about op which does dismiss their experience . 

 i do n't know what kind of experience you 've had with your experience being brushed aside , but i 'm going to make a bit of an assumption and say your experience is n't based on your skin colour ? 

 please show me where i 'm being hypocritical . 

 the historical loan issue is relevant because it 's still affecting things today .   if your grandma was poor and your mom was poor there is a good statistical chance that you will be poor .  

 black people , because of this racist districting , were given less opportunities to get a better education , better job , leave the neighborhood to give their children a better opportunity . ( not saying it never happens , sure it does , but it 's likely it wo nt . ) 

 you know that richer areas have richer and therefore higher rated schools . and colleges look at the school ranking while looking at grades in the us .   now just being born poor puts a student at a disadvantage . 

 the government , and some companies , made it so black families could n't afford to move to nicer areas and schools .   this direct racism still has lingering affects on the community . 

 understanding that people who put things in place were racist and you are accidentally contributing does n't mean you are racist , or that you are immune to problems . 

 it 's clear that not everything bad happens to black people because of racism ... but things still do and it really needs to stop already .   the fact that people are still affected by this racist bullshit is horrifying and it should really be stopped . 

 i never bashed you , please provide an example if you feel i did so i can re - read and apologize for my error . 

 lastly this may end you listening to me but [ white people are taught it 's okay to make racist jokes as long as a black person is n't   because bill maher accidentally said it on tv . 

 congrats , not sarcastically , for surrounding yourself with great people .   but there are racists in my family and i 've heard things i was shocked to hear at work and people i just met at a party or bar and have muttered to myself "" oh my god , it actually exists "" more times than i can count . 

 i 'm white , so it 's safe for them to be racist around me i guess .   if those people are being racist , a lot of people more than likely are . 

 so the article is saying : 

 > the arguments tend to focus on what good people they are and how it ’s not fair that the offending statement did n’t make it clear that it was n’t all white people . 
 > this reaction helps the bottom line of white supremacy because that system works best when no one talks about it .

 i 'm sure you can see why the mental connection occurred . 


 > lastly , you should listen to me because i am a graduate student who studies both racial and gender identity as well as inequality . 

 this is n't relevant to the discussion . not to belittle your accomplishments , but you are but one person stating your opinions on a subject ( racial identity ) that is being as widely discussed both within and outside academia ( at least at the moment with the incident at hand ) . similarly , one doctor does not get to define medical opinion . dr. oz is n't right simply because he 's a doctor and ostensibly an medical expert ( the more medical education you have , the more you 'll note how much incorrect information shows like his put out ) . he is either right or wrong because of the information he provides . an argument 's validity stands on its own , not who says it 

 > so in short , i know my stuff . 

 i do n't doubt that you do . i * do * doubt the value of this use of this use of the term trans - racial , especially in light of recent incidents . in your other reply you say "" a major point i intended to get across was the ambiguity of racial constructs and how difficult it is to make concrete categories of the body / identity if one considers how complex and diverse people are . "" if this vid was an attempt to redirect some of the conversation from the current discussion about "" transracial "" to one that focuses on this goal , i think you may have succeeded . 

 but let 's get back to my comment . while you spend some time in the video term transracial for yourself , you then go on to say "" we can say that transracialism exists because the majority of us are transracial "" ( around 5:29 ) . most people do not use the term to describe themselves nor is it part of the american vernacular . on the last census , 32 percent of people described themselves as multiracial ( although transracial was n't an option ) . if , as you ask a few seconds later , we have the right to define ourselves , why do you think this is ? and why should people start using your definition , as i mentioned in my original reply . do you think that they will gain something different from switching from multiracial ?",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_37104,"my black history month playlist it ’ s black history month . we are tasked with celebrating everything and everyone that gives this very short period the relevance it deserves . the recognizable names of figures that stood for something and even died for the sake of humanity always filter through . the timetable of events never deviates from the standard fare . for me , this time of year has evolved over time and experience . being black in america doesn ’ t resemble my assigned definition from twenty-years ago . back then , i identified as a nigerian-american which created an unconscious distance from a community that i am now fiercely protective of and proud to recognize . my political stance has been reshaped to accommodate the complexity of maturing which demands a level of awareness that can be blissfully enlightening and sometimes dishearteningly alarming . in the past three years , the racial divide in america , while maintaining its everlasting grip without danger of slipping — has grimly lifted to a higher plateau . white police officers are tasked with the power to mistreat black people at will with little or no consequences . the implementation of black lives matter was a necessary response to a chaotic climate that hasn ’ t yet dissipated . the fight continues . the struggle remains . the dead are remembered while the living celebrate an existence that is marred by the fact that there is still a valid reason why we must prove with all our might that our lives do matter . i have spent an impressive amount of time curating pieces that depict my frustration and utter disgust for a system that was callously designed to brutalize the lives of marginalized people in such an organic way that allows such practice to be an acceptable code of conduct . as protests against trump ’ s menacing presence in the white house continues to flow — it ’ s hard not be somewhat bitter when you consider the crowds who righteously and defiantly denounce the abhorrence in the air . it ’ s cool to be a part of a media event when it ’ s sponsored by the elite and coupled with the assurance of a non-violent clause . but , when they march for the sake of blackness — over the bloody trails that still encrypt the streets and the body marks that serve as the reminder of how a 12-year-old boy was shot in the stomach and left for dead — the stench of this political cause is somehow only reserved for those who have way more to lose . black history month is for all americans , especially since we are embodying a time that elevates the degree of discrimination that blatantly surpasses the hallmarks of white and black . as i go through my roster of offerings — there is evidence that i had a lot to be concerned about , and as i paid extra attention to the responses it was also clear how fragile the human spirit can be when it comes to processing a national crisis — that we seemingly can ’ t control no matter which side of the fence we claim . here are the tracks that i added to my playlist for the purpose of this month and every month after— including the ones beyond that will surely feature another senseless death and a helpless child watching in horror as the future is depicted with no filters .",medium_antiracist

 the people who are advantaged are the 1 % .   they divide the rest of us with intersectional oppression .   the idea that racialized groups are disadvantaged does not infer that working class people of any colour are not also disadvantaged , just that there are different levels or degrees of oppression .   the house slave was looked as advantaged by the field slaves , but rest assured , that did not mean he was not disadvantaged .  

 this is why mlk was organizing a second million - man march that including working class brothers and sisters , or comrades if you will .   he recognized that the entire purpose of racializing one group was to exploit their labour . 

 if you see this as a strictly black - and - white , then you are seeing it how your oppressor wants you to see it .   yes , there is discrimination based on perceived race .   but if you think passing civil rights bills is going to end oppression , then i think you underestimate capitalism .

 you believe that the activists in this group , being concerned with the traditional american social contract and economic conditions , ought to have understood that one particular instance of one particular meaning of occupation was the true ( or most important ) meaning of occupation .   that is , the word ' occupy ' meant "" to occupy the same way that european colonists occupied lands formerly used by natives "" , rather than the way the word ' occupy ' might mean "" to occupy in the same way that the iroquois confederacy occupied the ohio river valley "" , or "" to occupy in the way that students in the 1960s would occupy the administrative offices of their campuses "" . 

 you believe that it is easy to shift from a narrative of occupation to decolonization , and that these activists should have invited people who shared their concerns to gather in a geographical location more normally seem as belonging to the entities which are focus of their concern with reference to a narrative of * decolonization * , rather than occupation .   in the title of their movement .

 there are those who were raised in a overtly racist time / culture , some of whom are self - aware and fight those ingrained notions . others embrace them . 

 then there 's those who are ignorantly racist , through inexperience or a crap education . people who are either unaware of the struggles a group faces , or are unaware of the reason for the struggle and try to use their own life experiences to come to a conclusion ( "" i 've never had much trouble getting a job , so black unemployment must be so high because their culture encourages laziness .

medium_antiracist_15776,"on being a victim of racial abuse ( & feeling it ) earlier today , i was a victim of racial abuse . it was my lunch break and my colleague and i were walking through the local park when we encountered a group of youths . i didn ’ t feel like i was a victim at the time — i kept my head down and walked past as quick as possible , trying to ignore their taunts and slurs . looking back , it ’ s fascinating ( or just plain sad ) that looking down and not reacting has been my default reaction to these sorts of attacks all my life . perhaps my lack of response would discourage further abuse or it was a mechanism for myself to detach my emotions from the situation . i would like to consider myself a hardy person but as i sat at my desk afterwards , the numbness turned into hollowness . my desire to not feel like the victim had waned and all that was left was the feeling of being dehumanised . for me , this feeling was crushing — a realisation that you ’ re direct victim of someone ’ s hatred and that it ’ s actually worked . i wrestled with fear , anxiety , sadness and frustration . my thoughts become pre-occupied to those passing moments and how powerless it made me feel . i wanted to write about this experience and these feelings to express what i could not when i told my colleagues about what had happened . at the time i shrugged it off , not wanting to process those emotions and rejecting the notion of any sort of vulnerability on my part . hopefully , these few words will not come across as some sort of self-serving , egocentric piece but as my personal experience and perspective of being oppressed through racism .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_87783,"this is a pretty simple problem , and one that goes the opposite direction when americans visit countries with different tipping practices . it is discriminatory , perhaps , but it is not discrimination . 

 in france , for example , a 15%-ish charge is added to all food eaten there ( sur la place ) and generally discounted from the menu price if the food is "" a emporter "" - this money pays the server for their time and attention in a profession that relies * heavily * on tips . 

 however , many traveling americans who are unfamiliar with this will tip 18 - 25 % on their bill regardless , and you can bet your sweet ass that most waiters / waitresses are n't going to say "" oh , no , do n't do that . your gratuity is covered in the price . "" 

 so , in america , where restaurant servers are paid * about half the minimum wage * , tips are important . if the occasional foreigner comes in , takes up a table for 3 hours , and tips $ 1 on a $ 100 meal ( perhaps thinking that the tip is included like in their home country ) - no big deal , just another "" ugh this asshole did n't tip me anything "" story . if that happens 50 times a day from a huge influx of non - tipping foreigners / tourists , the waitresses get fucked , waste their time , and make no money . 

 when i 'm musicking in a restaurant , i rely on tips to make it worth my time . the hourly is shit and over - taxed , so the cash - on - hand helps pay gas / instrument costs - when people assume that "" oh , i 'm sure they pay the pianist well "" , it hurts me and i do n't make enough to want to keep playing there . although , incidentally , foreigners ( e.g. australia , scotland , england ) have consistently been my best tippers .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_2773,"i watched “ the ridiculous 6 ” so you don ’ t have to this past week i started seeing the headline “ netflix buries the ridiculous 6 ” all over my facebook newsfeed . i wondered what on earth they were talking about since i ’ m on netflix several times a day and it has been front and center every time i open the site . i actually did the # walkoffnetflix when news broke of indigenous actors walking off the set and they shared why . i also tweeted my displeasure @ netflix as an indigenous person who knows media interpretations of native americans impact my lived experiences , personal safety and how i am perceived in the world . lately though , i ’ ve been making use of my girlfriend ’ s account because i realized it was actually hard to go without any access . neither my girlfriend nor i are fans of adam sandler or other slapstick bromedy films , so if it ’ s an algorithm based on past viewing that has netflix “ hiding ” the film in some people ’ s feeds , it ’ s an unreliable algorithm . in any case , true to usual tendencies , i decided to watch the film and report back , so you don ’ t have to . i can actually keep this review fairly short and sweet , unlike the two hour film that made me feel like i had aged ten years and become the cranky “ get off my lawn ! ” yelling stereotype that so often pops up in a sandler film . for real , mr. sandler , get off my lawn ! within the first two minutes , we see derogatory names for native americans in print three times and hear derogatory names in dialogue three more times . within the next minute we are treated to an indigenous woman being harassed by a gang of men , and before we are five minutes in we find out this is a white savior movie . within the first ten minutes we can safely say the ridiculous 6 takes adam sandler movies to new levels of inane . and there are still another 110 minutes left to watch . ( yes , the film is “ unwatchable ” and yet i pressed on . i do this for you . if you feel sorry for me by the end of this review , please send chocolate chip cookies and some of your mom ’ s frybread . ) sandler films are well known for crass and crude “ jokes ” around sex and other body functions . the ridiculous 6 is full of them , from a wordless reenactment by a son of the sex act between his mother and the shared father of the six , to the barber sticking his finger up the butt of the burro and then promptly into the mouth of one of the brothers . from a diarrhea spewing burro to an unnecessary recounting of all the places in a room that one of the mothers engaged in handstand sex with the father . if you ’ re an adam sandler fan , this film has everything you love about him . but if you ’ re a fan you probably aren ’ t reading this , so for the rest of you this is just fair warning . to say the story and plot is bare bones would be an understatement . even for sandler films it is remarkably simple . sandler plays tommy/white knife , a white boy raised by the apaches who is preparing to marry an apache woman when his white bank robber father shows up in the village . dear old dad confesses to tommy that he is dying and that he wants his son and the tribe to have the $ 50,000 he has hidden away . he also tells tommy that his mother was “ the only one ” . the backstory is that tommy ’ s sweet mom was killed when she walked him to school one day to protect him from bullies . true to film form , the killer has a defining characteristic in the form of a horseshoe tattoo on his right hand . but wait , in a twist , tommy ’ s white father is kidnapped by a gang of ruffians and now tommy must go find the money to pay the ransom to get his father back . along the way he keeps running into men he immediately discovers are actually sons of his father also , his half-brothers . this “ loveable ” lot of grown men who all behave like pre-teens band together to steal the money necessary to rescue , and meet for the first time , their father . to be honest , i completely missed the plot point that explains how they ended up having to steal the money instead of finding the hiding place . because there is more than one gang of “ bad guys ” roaming around , the boys get robbed and have to keep stealing to come up with the money . in the end it turns out that dad was in with the gang all along and sent tommy out to steal money because he and his gang are too popular to not be recognized everywhere they go . also , the leader of the gang , cicero ( danny trejo — why ? why have you forsaken us ? ) , is the killer of tommy ’ s mother and his father knew it . naturally the brothers outwit everyone , join the tribe and live happily ever after . there are so many things wrong with the characterizations of the brothers . first you have the semi-redface of sandler ’ s character , then you have the brownface of rob schneider as a mexican brother . next you have taylor lautner ( remember when he pulled out his distant indigenous heritage to explain away his twilight role ? how does he explain this one ? ) as a “ half-wit ” and jorge garcia as a non-verbal moonshine-brewing mountain man , who it is joked later is the result of his mother “ hitting the moonshine pretty hard ” during her pregnancy . finally there is luke wilson as the closest thing to an adult in the film but still failing , and terry crews as the black son who can play the piano with his dick ( sadly , crews ’ character is the most interesting of the film ) . racism , ableism and sandler ’ s hallmark of mockery of the developmentally disabled shouldn ’ t surprise me , but it ’ s amazing how much of it gets packed into one film . additional racist awkwardness comes in the form of david spade as general custer ( insulting to even include , especially if he isn ’ t going to come to a bad end in the film ) and vanilla ice as mark twain , portrayed as an aave-speaking and dancing white “ bro ” . something tells me that after native actors publicized the reasons they walked off the film set there was some effort to cut back on some of the offensive aspects of the film , but the film is just so full of insults . yes , there really is an indigenous woman character named beaver ’ s breath , and tommy ’ s love is smoking fox . it ’ s really bad . the natives are mere props in the story , background that aren ’ t even featured through most of the film . what is far more problematic is the use of “ mystical shit ” throughout the film , whereby tommy concentrates , chants , and magically is able to blow open a bank safe , gain access to secure spaces , fight , and use knives to climb down the sides of tall buildings . his native father , the chief , speaks in motivational poster and pseudo-mystical platitudes . clearly no effort or money was expended on basic research to attempt to portray the indigenous in a remotely respectful manner . the tribe is the apache , but they are shown sleeping in teepees , a northern plains housing style . the clothing mixes northwest woodland styles , poca-hottie costumes designed to hypersexualize the women , plains styles and more . i ’ m no expert on all beadwork motifs and jewelry types , but even i can tell you there was nothing apache about the wardrobes , and the closest they came was the attempt at some weird excessively new and bright red scarves worn around the men ’ s heads in an awkward fashion . there was ample outrage expressed to netflix about this film and netflix should have reconsidered it . sandler should have taken the criticism and learned from it , but he didn ’ t . vanilla ice countered criticism by saying he is “ part native , ” as if that excuses being in an offensive film . i was more disturbed to see fine actors like terry crews and steve buscemi , who are known for often taking unpopular anti-oppression stances , in the movie . the fact is , the ridiculous 6 is a typical sandler/schneider vehicle . but it does sink to new levels of worthless crude potty humor , unintelligible story , and overall just not funny rudeness . add the over-the-top racism , and particularly the disrespect to native women , and there is no redeeming value to it at all . it ’ s not too late to tell netflix and sandler they can ’ t have your money anymore .",medium_antiracist

 the pieces that i 'm working on are pretty bold and kind of gory . the centerpiece of the installation is a bleeding human heart marred with bullets and cuts and broken glass . the painting is of an androgynous black person clawing at their throat , unable to breathe , and again , bruises and cuts and stuff marring their skin . i could have taken a different route with it , but in my mind , this is n't really time to be gentle about what i wanna say . the artwork is a statement , it 's bold and in your face and i want it to be something that you ca n't look away from despite the gore .

 i was actually very convinced by some arguments here that the concept of "" race "" is completely arbitrary and further apart from any biological description . in fact equaling "" race "" to "" skin color "" is a horrible social construction . rather it would mean a whole set of features which includes skin color and other physical and facial features . this should be nothing but an objective description of a stereotypical ethnic group .",reddit_antiracist

 and honestly , i think that the stigmatization of the racists / sexists / whateverists is probably something that they need to live with if they 're going to hold bigoted beliefs about people . 

 i do n't really think your analogy of attending a gay marriage is accurate . when i 'm viewing a link on reddit that does n't have any sort of pretense of race , gender , or sexual orientation and someone comments something bigoted it 's not because i was visiting a link where i wanted to read those types of comments-- i prefer to not even see them . which is completely different from me engaging someone about some sort of social issue-- i 'm totally all about it , but not when the person i 'm talking with hurls insults and is just simply trying to be a bully about it . 

 people are free to say whatever they want , but that does n't mean that what they say wo n't have any consequences or that they should n't be held accountable for them . i do n't think it 's problematic that i do n't want to see their comments if they do n't actually contribute anything worthwhile to the topic at hand other than just being an asshole about it . hell , i do n't even mind people trolling , i just do n't like reading language that 's meant to just bully people of color , women , glbts , etc .",reddit_antiracist

 & # x200b ; 

 1619 -   black people came to america in 1619 , 1 year before the pilgrims 

 1 . their stolen labor birthed the us economy and saved jamestown settlement 

 1630 - the city of boston is founded in the massachusetts bay colony 

 1718 - the city of new orleans is founded 

 1752 - the liberty bell is cracked when it is first rung 

 1770 - the boston massacre occurs , british police shoot up a crowd . 

 1773 - bostonian colonists protest the tea act with the boston tea party , where they riot and throw an entire beverage industry into the sea .   this is called "" independence "" for some reason 

 1775 - the revolutionary war begins with the declaration of independence , 156 years after the first slaves came to american shores . 

 1787 - 3/5ths compromise .   black people are counted for purposes of taxation and representation , but they only count as 3/5ths of a person . 

 1808 - usa abolishes the slave trade , but leaves existing american slaves in bondage . 

 1831 -   a slave named nat turner inspired a few dozen slaves from several virginia plantations to rise up .   turner led about seventy freedom fighters to kill about sixty white people over the course of two days .   nat turner and about 50 slaves were tried and executed . racist mobs rioted and lynched almost 200 more . they have been warning us how dangerous black people are since . 

 1850 - congress passed the fugitive slave act , which required all escaped slaves to be returned to their owners and american citizens to cooperate with the captures . 

 1857 - the us supreme court ruled : 

 > the constitution of the united states recognizes slaves as property , and pledges the federal government to protect it . and congress can not exercise any more authority over property of that description than it may constitutionally exercise over property of any other kind . ” 

 nov 1860 - lincoln is elected , even tho 10 states did not include him on the ballot . 

 dec 1860 - south carolina secedes from america with these words : 

 > by a vote of 169 - 0 , the south carolina legislature enacted an "" ordinance "" that "" the union now subsisting between south carolina and other states , under the name of ' the united states of america , ' is hereby dissolved . 

 jan 1861 - mississippi , florida , alabama , georgia , louisiana and texas secede from america 

 feb 1861 - the states combine to form the confederate states of america , an entirely different nation , and elect jefferson davis president 

 apr 1861 - fort sumter , confederate forces fired shots at the fort and american troops surrendered .   this sparked the civil war , which lasted 4 years . 

 apr 1861 - virginia secedes from america and joins the confederacy 

 may/ june 1861 - arkansas , north carolina , and tennessee follow suit . 

 1862 - congress outlaws slavery 

 1863 - lincoln issues the emancipation proclamation 

 1864 - lincoln is re - elected to a second term 

 april 9 , 1865 - general lee surrenders , the civil war ends , and the confederacy of 11 states ends 

 lincoln is assassinated 5 days later . the kkk was formed a few months later in tennessee on christmas eve . 

 1870s - 1970s : there was a 10 year period after the civil war , where black people voted and were elected and were able to participate in the government ,   but within 10 years , the kkk kicked them out and instituted a system of anti - black laws that lasted 100 years until mlk was killed in 1968 . 

 this system of laws lasted officially all the way to the 1970s .   and all those assholes are still in power .

reddit_antiracist_68661,"here 's what i think . i 'm white as well , and while i 've never had someone accuse me of hating my own race , i 'm ready for that . i 've had some ridiculous conversations with alt - right morons on reddit , where they told me i was just adding to the divisions in this country , etc . while i do n't think that white people deserve a pat on the back for being anti - racist , i think it 's dumb to say that we are self - hating white people . 

 i think it 's absurd to call a white person "" racist against their own race "" because it 's implying that "" reverse racism "" is real .   it 's not real , because it 's not possible to be racist against white people . white people are the group with all the power and they maintain that power by oppressing everyone else . one of the ways white people maintain that power is by remaining "" innocent "" from race and racism . we do n't understand these concepts because we never discuss them at any level beyond the most basic conversations , and we pat ourselves on the back for coming to the conclusion that "" it 's not nice to be mean "" . most of us think that 's the extent to what racism means , so we get defensive when the conversations go any deeper . many of us will not accept that structural racism exists , because we do n't already understand it . partly because it does n't happen to us , but also because it does n't fit into the surface level mr. rogers neighborhood - esque discussions we have . so when we do have anything slightly deeper than surface level conversations , people find it too harsh and we seem bad for having uncomfortable conversations . white people 's feelings should not be protected from the realities of whiteness . 

 we also do n't understand that just because someone is n't hateful , that does n't mean they do n't have anything to unpack .   white people are programmed to have unconscious biases about other races all our lives , all of us do , even those of us who make efforts to undo racism . race and racism are things that i spend a lot of time studying and trying to educate myself on , but i 'm still white so i still have biases . i 'm 25 , so i have a quarter century of racist societal conditioning to work through , but i have to be honest with myself and be willing to call myself out on my biases . i have a diverse group of friends , but that 's not going to make all my conditioning just disappear . occasionally i do make assumptions about people based on harmful stereotypes , and i always catch myself . and although i feel disgusted for making these assumptions , i do n't let myself just forget about it . i think it through until i figure out what incorrect bias i still have and work to rid myself of it . it 's an uncomfortable process , but it 's necessary . white people in general are not willing to go through this process because we do n't like the discomfort , but mostly because we do n't want to see ourselves as bad . 

 that 's my rationale for if anyone accuses me of being a self - hating white person . i 'm not racist against my own race . i do n't feel disgusted when i see my own skin . i 'm not driven to have these beliefs by white guilt . and i 'm not trying to get a pat on the back for having the correct opinions . i 'm just honest with myself . i 'm honest about my own unconscious biases , i 'm honest about where those biases come from , i 'm honest about my privilege , and i 'm honest about what it means to be white in our society . i 'm not trying to protect my own feelings , and i 'm not trying to protect other white people 's feelings either . there 's nothing toxic about what you 're doing .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_12405,"dear white people , here ’ s how to give thanks today one way to give thanks for all that we have is to acknowledge our history and consider how we came to have all that we give thanks for in the first place . by now , most of us know at least some of the truth behind thanksgiving . the pilgrims landed ( in 1620 ) and the natives at plymouth , the wampanoag tribe , offered them food and skills and helping them to survive a harsh winter . after the pilgrims survived due to assistance from the wampanoag tribe , their governor , william bradford , proclaimed a day of thanksgiving — not for the generosity of the people whose land they just arrived on , who they referred to in primary texts as “ infidels ” and “ heathens ” , but for the resilience and “ resourcefulness ” of his own good christian white people . they , along with droves of other europeans in other parts of the americas , proceeded to massacre , enslave , and displace indigenous peoples from their own land , virtually wiping out entire populations in the process . governor bradford himself , the “ founder ” of thanksgiving , led raids and massacres on entire villages . from the trail of tears to standing rock , this mistreatment , violence , and forced displacement has continued throughout our entire history . it ’ s been present throughout the entirety of the americas , from christopher columbus landing on hispaniola ( now haiti and the dominican republic ) and subsequently wiping out virtually the entire native taíno population in only 25 years , to european colonizers ransacking of every corner of the americas to enslave natives and steal gold , from what pizarro did to the incas of peru to what cortez did to the aztecs in mexico . this year , our thanksgiving is troublingly similar to the “ first thanksgiving ” . we are not massacring native americans , but the arc has been bent only a hair for the standing rock sioux tribe , who are still being pushed even farther off their land ( now for oil rather than gold ) and this very week were again violently attacked for peacefully protecting it . history repeats itself . if , as a person of privilege , it feels long , it is difficult to imagine how long it must feel for those who are systematically oppressed . for many , it must feel as if progress has stalled entirely , or sometimes even reversed . oppression is tricky — it has a way of rebranding itself over time , taking on different names and forms but maintaining the same core spirit . from slavery to jim crow , to from segregation to housing discrimination and gentrification , from lynching to police brutality and hate crimes . we ’ ve cured diseases , industrialized the land and secured trade deals with other nations to provide us a wealth of different options for food and material items , developed means for reacting to natural disasters , and improved sanitization standards . but who do these achievements serve ? certainly not people who don ’ t have access to healthcare , nor people who live in food deserts in the u.s. or work in foreign factories and on corporate agriculture plantations with unsafe labor conditions to make the shoes we wear and grow the pineapple we eat . they don ’ t serve black people in new orleans ( hurricane katrina ) or haiti ( too many to name ) , nor do they serve people who live in flint , michigan . they most certainly do not serve our environment . we ’ ve won women the right to vote and the right to choose , only to elect a president who actively disrespects women , brags about violating their bodies , and threatens to seriously set back reproductive rights . for many women of color , between widespread voter discrimination and the hyde amendment ( which bans abortion coverage from people on medicaid ) , these privileges that should be rights never existed in the first place . notice how i ’ ve jumped around from thanksgiving to hurricanes to abortion rights ? these issues may span vastly different geographic regions , demographics , and time periods , but they are all connected . never forget the ways in which these problems intersect , because it is at their intersections that the truth of what powers them is found . it is only through intersectionality and inclusivity that we will ever be able attack the core of what plagues all of our seemingly disparate injustices . this will require that we fight for others , even when it does not benefit us , even when it requires our own sacrifice in return . progress is too often won only for people of privilege , and sometimes only at the hands of the oppressed . the problem is that much of the bounty that we now enjoy was not made by us , or by our ancestors , but taken . much of the prosperity in western nations exists as a direct result of what we have taken from other , mostly brown , nations and indigenous peoples . much of the prosperity of our own nation was taken from natives or created on the backs of slaves . we must recognize how we are tied to our ancestors and how our history shapes us . but , we are not our ancestors , and we are not our history . we can overcome if we listen , stay aware , speak out , and care . we are more educated , more empathetic , and more willing to sacrifice and fight for others . we can help make real progress happen . in a people ’ s history of the united states , howad zinn writes of the 1960s and 70s while discussing native american resistance movements , “ never in american history had more movements for change been concentrated in so short a span of years. ” let ’ s beat that record . it is time to refocus our progress toward equality by fighting for more than our own progress . it ’ s time to bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice for all . so , as you gather around the table to give thanks ( side note : your food didn ’ t come from jesus unless you ’ re referring to an immigrant named jesus who picked it only to be accused of stealing his own job ) , consider this country ’ s and this holiday ’ s history . and to show thanks for all you have , consider sacrificing more to support others in their fight for justice . follow sacred stone camp for updates and go to sacredstonecamp.org to donate to the camp , contribute to their legal defense , and get the latest updates . check out their blog , # nodapl solidarity , for more ways to take action . standwithstandingrock.net — standing rock ’ s official website for people who want to take action in opposing dapl — has outlined several very clear-cut , simple ways that you can act now . sign the petition , call the white house , and then consider using your holiday spirit to donate what you can or purchase supplies off their amazon wishlist today . make sure that your actions and donations are coming from one of these official pages — there are amazon wishlists and gofundme accounts floating around that are not officially associated with the camp . do one ( or several ) of these things to show thanks today . stay tuned to get involved on december 1st for a # nodapl day of action , and have a happy thanksgiving . “ the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends towards justice. ” — martin luther king jr .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_6862,"# blacklivesmatter is necessary because white lives matter more no matter how we try to escape the truth of police brutality against people of color — the evidence at our disposal is strikingly illustrative of why black america is in uproar . i ’ ve decided that the likes of sean hannity who are part of an entity that strives to dismantle the fact that black people are truly hunted animals — enjoy mocking the notion that we dare to fight for the right to live . hannity is a gross human being . so gross , that he harassed a reporter stationed in baton rouge — the site of a protest in the name of black injustice . the fox news henchman demanded to know why black people feel the need to remind clueless folks that we are in fact actual human beings . his disruptive pursuits perfectly sum up why we have to work so hard for basic rights . anyone that entertains the thought that # blacklivesmatter is our version of black privilege is seriously fucked up . the crowd was on a mission . they needed to validate the life of a local man that was destroyed by a white cop for reasons that will never measure up . his task was to invalidate a well-thought out plan by jeering at the message and rendering the participants — unworthy . # blacklivesmatter is a movement that despite the rampant killings and bereaved families — still manages to save lives daily . shit is going down and we ’ re dying faster than ants trampled over the hill of dust . white people get to do whatever they want — wherever and survive the program — but black people can ’ t risk being rambunctious . tamir rice tried being a 12-year-old boy starring in a western and he was shot to death with a real gun . by a real person . but , like they say . you can ’ t relate until it happens to you . since its pretty clear that no white man or woman will ever be shot to death for being white — black people have to distinguish themselves from the elite . we have to come to terms with the fact that unless we publicly identify ourselves as humans — we will continue to be subjected to inhumane treatments . the smug approach and lack of compassion for a race that has been consistently stripped and regulated to unimaginable fodder is the epitome of white privilege . i don ’ t believe that in his quiet moments — hannity struggles with identifying why # blacklivesmatter was instituted . i think he ’ s like most white people who are so removed from the horrors of racial discord that they prefer to maintain that distance in order to sleep really well at night . y ’ all know we ’ re suffering and while some of you empathize the rest of you continue to prove why we need to embarrassingly convince you that we matter . so , here ’ s the deal . if we had the same rights that white america enjoys without question — black america wouldn ’ t have the audacity to proclaim why they deserve a chance to make it — against all odds . this isn ’ t an attention seeking venture and it ’ s not a festival sponsored by organizations that have nothing better to invest in . it ’ s not a fad that will fade once the cries die out . # blacklivesmatter is the passport that every black person needs in order to be secured in the knowledge that when a white cop strikes again — the movement will strike back . if you don ’ t like it — maybe you can spend your time and energy tackling the complex graph of race relations in america . we need a solution and until that whiz kid comes up with the winning formula — black people are screwed . that ’ s why # blacklivesmatter is a thing .",medium_antiracist

 as far as what happens on the streets , i 'm very sorry and disheartened to hear about what happened to your mom ... i wish that those racists will get what they deserve , but as we all know , life is n't fair in that way .. 

 as far as that particular problem , i 've been thinking about it since awhile back , and i think that a body cam of some sort for civilians would be a great way to catch these guys and make them pay .. i 'm not sure what device is best to serve this function - being able to record up to 24/7 while also being small enough to remain concealed . 

 i 've done this with my phone ( but concealing a phone camera can be hard ) .. there 's an app on android called autoguard .. its meant for use as a dash cam , but i believe its well suited to our predicament because it is able to record continuously and stream to youtube ( so you 're not limited by the space on your phone . another good app is streamlabs , which streams to youtube or other rtmp server in realtime ( nothing is saved on your phone - it goes straight to the cloud , you got ta make sure the streams are saved somehow , video quality is amazing ) . 

 there are bodycams on amazon , but i have no idea how good they are .. i 'd imagine the recording quality wo nt be as good as that of a smart phone ..

medium_antiracist_8657,"colin kaepernick ’ s stand against racial injustice in the land of the free founding father and slave owner thomas jefferson ’ s mantra that , “ when injustice becomes law , resistance becomes duty , ” is today exemplified in the stance taken by nfl quarterback , colin kaepernick , with his refusal to stand for the us national anthem prior to the san francisco 49ers ’ recent preseason game against the green bay packers . as kaepernick told the press afterwards , “ i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color . to me , this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way . there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder . '' kaepernick ’ s stand is with the growing number of victims of police brutality in america , specifically blacks who ’ ve been gunned down by law enforcement officers in controversial circumstances , and over the lack of prosecutions when it comes to the officer ’ s involved . it is a controversy and national scandal which confirms that when it comes to law enforcement and justice , there are two americas . there is the land of opportunity that is the domain of most white people , otherwise known as the american dream , and there is the american nightmare which is the lived experience of black and brown people , predominately located in the country ’ s sprawling inner cities . malcolm x put it thus : “ no , i ’ m not an american . i ’ m one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of americanism . one of the 22 million black people who are the victims of democracy , nothing but disguised hypocrisy . so , i ’ m not standing here speaking to you as an american , or a patriot , or a flag-saluter , or a flag-waver — no , not i. i ’ m speaking as a victim of this american system . and i see america through the eyes of the victim . i don ’ t see any american dream ; i see an american nightmare. ” predictably , the 28-year old quarterback has been hit with a tsunami of criticism over his stance , demonised as unpatriotic and a disgrace to the nfl . his critics have taken particular umbridge over the fact kaepernick recently signed a six-year $ 114 million contract with the 49ers , thereby inferring that being rich and not having a social conscience are two sides of the same coin . indeed kaepernick , who is of mixed race parentage , is deserving of even more respect given his wealth , as the people he ’ s taking a stand with — victims of police brutality — are overwhelmingly poor or from low income communities . if there is one thing white america hates it is having its mask of democracy and liberty removed to reveal the true face of a nation that was established upon the genocide of the indigenous population , prior to being built on the whipped and gnarled backs of millions of slaves . it is a country that still today exists at the negation of people of colour , disproportionately making up the ranks of the astounding 47 million of us citizens living in poverty in the second decade of the 21st century . regardless of the long and courageous struggle of the civil rights movement , regardless of the raft of laws passed against racial discrimination , and regardless of a constitution that enshrines the principle that , “ all men are created equal , ” in 2018 america has yet to come to terms with the racism and inequality that lie at the heart of its culture and cultural values . you only have to consider the rise and popularity of republican presidential candidate , donald trump , to understand the extent of the recrudescence of bigotry and prejudice in the land of the free — almost to the point where you could be forgiven for thinking the pro-slavery confederacy that won the country ’ s 1861–65 civil war . colin kaepernick is not the only high profile voice that ’ s been raised against the ongoing injustice being suffered by black people and people of colour in america recently . beyonce has also attracted criticism for taking the same stand during her performance at the mtv video music awards in new york with her depiction of a police shooting . in taking the public position they have , kaepernick and beyonce are standing on the shoulders of other black american athletes and performers who ’ ve refused to look the other way in a society in which they have succeeded in achieving financial and professional success . in so doing they have earned something far more valuable than any contract , endorsement , or paycheque ; they have earned a place in history . paul robeson , muhammad ali , tommie smith , john carlos — their names live on as a reminder that only live fish can swim against the tide , and that it is upon those with the courage to say no to injustice , to refuse to go along to get along , that justice and freedom depends . to those who insist that every americas should respect the national anthem and the flag it reveres , here again we see the disjunction between the myth of america and its ugly truth . the star spangled banner was written by a man , francis scott key , who ’ d tasted defeat in the us war of independence at the hands of former slaves fighting on the side of the british against the future of slavery and oppression that awaited them and their families in the event that the men such as he prevailed . key ’ s disdain for black soldiers , colonial marines , who dared take up arms to fight for their freedom from slavery and racial oppression , is laid out in a verse of the star spangled banner that nowadays is never sung — or at least certainly not in public . colin kaepernick courage reminds us of the timeless wisdom embodied in the words of south africa ’ s archbishop desmond tutu , “ if you are neutral in situations of injustice , you have chosen the side of the oppressor. ” more than neutral , the quarterback ’ s critics are the kind of people oscar wilde had in mind when he described patriotism as the “ virtue of the vicious. ” end . no refuge could save the hireling and slavefrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave , and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth waveo ’ er the land of the free and the home of the brave .",medium_antiracist

 it 's not that i ca n't think someone is "" racist "" unless they identify as it .   i just interact with people that way .   if i say "" hey , that 's racist "" to someone who does n't think he 's racist , he 'll often say "" uhh , no .   i do n't think that other races are lower than any other races , or inherently different .   here 's the definition from wikipedia . "" he gets all defensive .   if i say "" hey , that 's racist "" to a self - identifying racist , he 'll say "" yeah ?   and i 'm racist , got a problem with that ? ""   you 're dealing with two different beasts here .  

 i oppose calling people who do n't feel like they 're racist "" racist "" because the thread of conversation is instantly derailed .   call something that is n't "" kkk style "" racist racist on reddit , see what happens .   people stop talking about whether it 's harmful or not harmful , and instead focus on whether it has the all - important label of "" racist "" .   what makes the matter worse are those -- predominantly feminist -- who say that power is a necessary component of racism , and that minorities inherently ca n't be racist .   that definition was made up , and is manipulative .   i understand the thought process behind it -- it 's to counteract those with privilege calling those threatening their privilege racist against them -- but it just seems to me to make the problem so much worse .  

 it 's just gotten to the point where "" racist "" is just a word thrown to offend each other .   a poisonous label tossed around like a hot potato .   the issue of whether the thing is wrong or not is forgotten ... and that 's * all * that matters .    so i just take the conservative position and use the classic definition , which happens to be the least controversial .   i just do n't even bring the word up , and people seem to respond to my criticism much less defensively and openly than if i open with "" that 's racist because ....

 2 ) i 'm not sure of anything being "" all - black "" . i think it 's mainly somethat is traditionally black . this most likely stems from the earlier days when whites people preferred the "" separate but equal "" doctrine and had most of the privileges , whereas you typical black person did nt have much available to him that was equal , if not even separate . thus , these are remainders of that . i think you will find something similar in other minorities , the fact of the matter when we think racist in america ( and perhaps even in general ) we tend to automatically jump to black vs white . the other reason why i think it 's even okay for minorities ( black , latino , asian , native american , and to some degree women ) to even have such things without to many question or scrutiny is possibly because there still exists stigmata , disparities , and general imbalance that and possibly a lot white guilt possibly .",reddit_antiracist

 that is false . iirc , that was the last sentence of his 2nd paragraph . but it appears he deleted it . 

 > then suddenly mean the entire race of the individuals or countries using such arguments are thereby lumped into the same group 

 first , if we accept this statement , then this quote just defeated his argument that it was based on nationality and that it should be europeans instead of whites . thanks for supporting my argument , unless the polish are not considered europeans . 

 i 'm confused as to your counterpoint to me differentiating between race and ethnicity . and even though the polish never had overseas colonies , they ( like many countries ) attempted to . 

 it seems like you and the op are more comfortable with ignoring the importance of race throughout the history of colonization . you ca n't ignore it and any attempt to do so "" paints an unsubtle picture of a very nuanced , historical past "" 

 finally , and this is the most important point , you 'll note that my comment above is unchanged . if you reread my comment , you 'll note that i did n't "" criticise and conflate ' white ' people with colonialism "" . i said the following ( emphasis added ) 

  "" furthermore , i reject your premise . earlier on , you claim "" that the juxtaposition [ of white and colonialism ] paints an unsubtle picture of a very nuanced , historical past "" . while i agree that exploitive behavior is n't a racial characteristic , a ) * * race was one of the main reasons used to justify this behavior * * and b ) you have not proven that it was due to nationality . it 's easy to find primary sources detailing how the indigenous populations were not worthy of the land ( or autonomy or equality ) or otherwise dehumanizing them because of their race . * to say it has nothing to do with race is ignoring history * "" 

 i did not say that white people should be stigmatised . or even that they should be conflated with colonialism . or whatever strawman you 're arguing with in your head . i said race was a factor . i wish his post was available so i could point out what i responded to . 

 edit : did the comment i responded to get deleted as well ?   should i just quote everything i respond to now ? 

 to be clear , this is the comment i responded to : 

 > at no point did he claim it had nothing to do with race , that is very clearly putting words into his mouth . 
 yes , while race was used to justify the behavior justifications related to certain events do n't then suddenly mean the entire race of the individuals or countries using such arguments are thereby lumped into the same group . jihadists have been known to refer to the ' white devil ' in their rhetoric and arguments but we do n't then claim that all muslims or middle eastern individuals should be condoned and associated with that . 
 in regards to the ethnicity aspect of your argument , that is exactly the point . colonialism was not a white phenomenon , the exampled polish never had a colonial empire and neither did many of the other eastern european nations , yet they are considered white . it was predominantly the most western european nations , britain , france , etc . yet ' white ' is conflated with colonialism as if every member of that race in this period took part in and supported the colonial efforts . 
 to criticise and conflate ' white ' people with colonialism is the same as criticising and conflating ' brown ' people with terrorism . its an easy way to generalise and stigmatise a large group of people for whatever gain is desired .

 & # x200b ; 

 i am from north - african origin , and i did experiment a lot of racism in the neighboring countries , even though the color of my skin is not different and we have the same religion and speak the same language with the exception of the noticeable accent . 

 but in my own country of origin , i always belong to something(s ) , a tribe and a city to name a few . and i can tell you that there are all kind of discrimination around based on where i belong to or a tribe i originated from . 

 when i moved to europe i experimented an even deeper shock from the racism there , this one though is at another level , with more disruptive and damaging effect on the short , and more importantly , on the long term . and i can tell from experimenting it for over a decade ; one can not thrive in a racist or discriminating environment , i 've been there and did that ... 

 & # x200b ; 

 your question is very much reasonable , but racism is here to stay , and i encourage you to learn from it more than trying to avoid it , just because it is everywhere you go either way . i learned from racism a lot of things ; the most important of them is avoiding being racist myself .

reddit_antiracist_64410,"there are so many more instances , but i think i 've made my point .   
 it really hit our second child hard , as years went on , with school and friends . she had to deal with a lot of people making fun of her for having a "" mexican mom "" ( again , my wife is native american ) or not believing she was her mother at all . in second grade , she was embarrassed about it and actually convinced her entire class and teacher , that she was adopted from england , ( again , i travelled a lot for work back then , so guess it was believable ) and my wife had no idea until she was stood up at a mothers day brunch and congratulated for taking on a child that needed a home . that was probably the only time my wife actually lashed out a bit . after she spoke with the teacher and realized what was going on , she said to everyonne in there , that our daughter was hers , no matter what they were told ! she carried her in her body , went through 22 1/2 hours of labor to bring that little girl in to the world , all by herself ( i was in korea when our daughter was born ) and she was , in fact ( insert daughters name ) biological mother , and no one was to say another word otherwise .   
 did n't really work , however , as our oldest son ( who has a darker skin tone , but not as dark as my wife ) ended up being suspended a few weeks later for getting in a fist fight ( in 4th grade , mind you ) because another kid kept calling his sister , his "" step - sister "" and how they really were n't siblings .   
 when our fourth child was born and came out with a darker skin tone then # 2 and # 3 , but the same as # 1 , rumors started flying about that my wife cheated on me and # 4 was not my son . we moved to where we live now when he was just a few months old though , and left those rumors behind , in the south .   
 thought things would be a bit better in a northern state , but it 's not . they are just more subtle about it . again , did n't realize the town we were moving to was segregated , by location , with our home being in the upper class , "" white "" portion of the town . my wife found the house and it was one of two houses that were in the area that had five bedrooms . the other house was in a different town , much older , priced higher and was in a "" historic "" part of that town , meaning that we would have to get approval to make any changes to the house from the town ( kind of like an hoa , but without an hoa ... ) . both were in really good school districts , so we chose the one that would be less in taxes and have no restrictions to the land we bought .   
 it was n't until after we moved in that we realized that we lived in the "" upper crust "" part of the town .   
 same issues occurred with the schools , thinking my wife was a step parent , babysitter or nanny to # 2 and # 3 . as # 3 grew , he did n't take it anywhere near as hard as our daughter did . he just brushed it off and told anyone who commented that she was his mom and get over it .   
 about 3 years after we moved in , another mixed race couple moved in next to us ( he is asian , she is white ) , and my wife was no longer the only brown person in the neighborhood . that was eight years ago though , and they are still the only poc in the neighborhood ( if you do n't include the kids ) .  
 then # 5 was born ... and it all started over again . our 5th child looks like me ( all of our kids look just like me , except our oldest , he is a mix of both his mother and me ) , but has the coloring of my wife , so he is a shade or two darker then our others , who have a darker skin tone .   
 so , of course , my wife must have cheated ! do n't get me wrong , there was zero drama at the hospital ( like you see in stories on here about babies being born and dad 's being held away because it was obvious the kid was n't his ) . but it did start pretty quickly after we brought him home . i do find it ironic though that our kids come out light , they must not be hers , they come out brown , and ... even though she 's brown , she 's a dirty little cheater ... so what color would be acceptable for our kids to be ?   
 at her six week follow up , after giving birth , the nurse said something along the lines of : mexican babies are just the cutest babies , i think ! ( again , she is native american , not mexican ) .  
 people at my work just could n't understand that he was so much darker then our other kids ( really , he is n't that much darker , and his mother is still darker then him , just not by much ) and wondered if my wife might have cheated with someone "" of her own kind "" ( one of the segregated parts of our town is hispanic / mexican and for some reason that 's what everyone thinks she is ) which is why the baby was so dark , so on , so forth . when he started kindergarten , he had to describe himself for a project and the teachers assistants ( read : parent volunteers )   helped the kids with their hair color , eye color , and so on . well , whoever helped our son , wrote on his project that he was mexican and later on that evening when # 2 ( again , our daughter , who takes it the hardest ) saw his project , she exploded and asked me what i was going to do about it ( wife was working late ) .   
 again , there is many more , with just a couple of days ago , our son thinking he was darker skinned then his mom and her liftin his shirt and putting her hand against his belly to show his face and arms might be darker as he has been playing on the swing set outside and has got a bit of sun , but he should n't worry , because mama is even darker . ( turns out # 4 's teacher 's aide , actually employed by the school , not a parent volunteer , made a comment about how different they looked and when # 4 argued how everyone says they look so much alike , she mentioned his skin tone . he told # 5 and that 's what got # 5 upset that he did n't "" look "" like the others . ( my wife reported the teachers aide ) . turns out the aide , is a parent of one of the teenagers that accused my wife of being racist to our daughter .   
 so , that is why my wife is upset . she opened a can of worms with her costume choice that is effecting 4 out of 5 of our kids . oldest is in college and thinks everyone who comments on anyones heritage or skin tone is an idiot ... and does n't get riled up over it , unless someone directly comments on his mother to him which rarely happens , since he can easily pass as either mixed or just white , with a year round tan . again , they all got my german / european features , but a few got her coloring . ( edit to add , i take that back , # 2 definitely got the native american nose , but with all of her other features being european , no one has ever noticed that , outside of my wife 's family ) .  
 anyway , so sorry to rant about it . it 's obviously something that 's been festering in me for a while . did n't mean to go off about it , and since only one person commented on the original post ( thank you , by the way ) i doubt it will get seen , but man ... it just feels good to get off my chest .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_46833,"taino reconnection with a dash of lateral violence by julia feliz this is not an easy conversation . addressing the ways in which oppressed communities are oppressive to one another is bound to trigger defensiveness and denial . however , if we are to heal and move forward as a community , we must address lateral violence and the ways in which taíno reconnecting spaces uphold their own people ’ s oppression . i invite you to have this pressing conversation with your community . if you find yourself having learned a thing or two from this or any of my other work , i would appreciate your support if even just $ 1 or $ 5 via venmo @ juliafeliz or buy me a coffee via www.ko-fi.com/juliafeliz you can learn more about my me and my work via www.juliafeliz.com * * * i didn ’ t set out to collect examples of lateral violence . it ’ s something that just happened because , sadly , it is that common within the taíno reconnecting movement . i had set out to join a tribe thinking that the main goal of those claiming taino from borikén would be to ensure native status and reparations in order to stop the further colonization of our island and the further oppression of the 3.5+ millions of boricuas on the island and those outside that have had to leave due to colonialism . i also understood these would be spaces to help further understand myself within my indigenous ancestors ’ traditions . sadly , i could not have been more wrong . in the taino reconnection community , what i found was a disorganization of people appointed as leaders fighting for the top of yet another hierarchy based on the “ masters ’ tools ” ( bell hooks ) . i first encountered a diasporic “ taino ” community in 2019 during a trip to upstate new york . this was only my second time in the state but my first lesson in indigenous-based lateral violence as someone born and raised on the island of borikén actively decolonizing and unlearning while learning the reality of our past and how it connected to our ( my ) present . at the time , i had been publicly documenting my identity journey and bringing up difficult interconnections between communities for several years at that point . my biggest endeavor had been going from solely understanding myself as simply “ puerto rican ” to a queer , two-spirit , afro-taino neurodivergent , disabled disruptor born and raised on borikén to boricua and dominican parents . in essence , my upbringing , culture , traditions , and how i understood myself and my identities had been one outside of the direct grasp from the u.s. settler system on the mainland . as i aged and found the strength to live as my authentic-self , my goal became to understand myself across lenses in order to help build bridges between the different communities i had found to be mine outside my puerto ricanness— ones that have been otherized and whose identities labeled as wrong under colonialism . most importantly , i wanted to disrupt my family ’ s inherited internalized anti-blackness and anti-indigeneity by shining a light to our roots and uncovering what exactly they meant beyond an obvious given as people tied to the caribbean . i began openly stating parts of me that had been drowned out and shamed due to things like colorism and classism . during my trip to new york , i proudly openly identified myself as black and indigenous/taino . i had no idea that taino organized groups existed outside of the caribbean . so , i was thrilled when i happened to come upon a taino group at an indigenous festival . after introducing myself to the taino elder and building a relationship , i remembered receiving a phone call one day from the elder commenting that the taino in that areas did not like that i openly claim our african ancestors and introduced myself as afrotaino . apparently , it upset people . i wasn ’ t surprised , however . i had been shamed my entire life for being part dominican . i do remember being confused at the pushback , however , because as far as i could see , many of the taino in the group , had even more stereotypically marked african features than i had , including rich dark skin and tight curls like my black dominican father . i quietly asked myself if they understood that those of us from the caribbean were undeniably majority tri-racial people due to our colonial history . another one of the members private messaged accusing me of being a traitor for dating outside my “ indigenous community ” . this was not as shocking as one might think , however , since i had grown up hearing similar sentiments from family members on the island dictating what gender and race i was allowed to date ( remnants of a very present colonialist history that followed me as i aged ) . while i was more fluid in understanding that my identity was made up by several roots that had become intertwined as one , the members of this group seemed to be holding on to a single strand of our heritage in order to understand their identities . i accepted these interactions as examples of how deep and far internalized colonialism extended beyond the island in the mainland . unaddressed internalized anti-blackness and a defined authenticity were this group ’ s main source for identifying who was one of them despite also readily accepting support , funding , and decision-making within the community from white centered institutions . while i still didn ’ t have the words to describe the experience ( i would later learn this term from an oneida tribe member as lateral violence ) , i understood it as validation for my continuing to openly carry my identities wherever i went . making peace with my own identity conflicts according to how i was being perceived would eventually be what would heal me and bring me closet to my ancestors years later . identity conflict is internalized colonialism . how we identify and how we are identified is based on perceptions created by the colonizers themselves upon their arrival on our shores in 1492 . to this very day , most of us are still classified according to racist perceptions and categories created by european eyes . white versus indigenous versus black positioning everyone in between above blackness but always below whiteness . splitting us up by features decided upon the spanish-sent colonizers created racial and class hierarchies which gave birth to the goal of blanqueamiento ( whitening ) and competition between groups violently pinned against the other according to racialized stereotypes identified by proximity or non-proximity to white europeans . it ’ s no secret that resentment grew between marginalized groups due to benefits and status awarded to those above them . the resentment created gaps between people from the same communities simply because whiteness had decided that those with proximity to it and those who obeyed the new laws and lived as expected meant they were of higher standing in settler society . those below the top tier , unable to vent their fear , frustration , and anger , and in an attempt to climb higher in society began practicing lateral violence . rather than oppression directed towards marginalized people by the white settlers that hold power across turtle island , lateral violence developed as a form of oppression that people who are marginalized/oppressed by a society in which those accepted as white hold power , began committing against one another . lateral violence is inherently internalized colonialism , and the idea behind it is that “ no one wants to be the lowest on the chain. ” colonialism introduced european hierarchical chains to kiskeya ( dominican republic ) and borikén ( puerto rico ) , in 1492 and 1493 , respectively . the chains were those based on otherization of indigeneity in order to begin normalizing hierarchies of power over others . these are the same hierarchies that descendants of the taino and africans brought to the caribbean continue to embrace to this day , unknowingly as we separate and categorize ourselves according to colorism and specific features determined by those of european descent . following the racialized class system , further hierarchies and oppressive systems were also born on our continent based on physical and mental ability , cis-ness , straight-ness , binarism , and other forms of discriminatory violence people faced based on a european religion and standards . oppressive people ’ s then used these tools themselves to oppress their own and create hierarchies of power over those deemed less worthy beyond just race . lateral violence is a way to uphold the hierarchy and reproduce colonialism within oppressed groups in the form of assigning less value to those who have even less privileges than we do . ( more via creative spirits/j . korffs 2020 & 2021 ) this type of violence thrives through group bullying , ignoring , silencing , exclusion , and playing by other colonial rules and enforced standards rooted in the “ -isms ” and “ -phobias ” that we as a society have readily accepted in order to climb our own power ladders : classism , binarism , sexism , racism , homophobia , transphobia , neuroableism , ableism , etc… without blackness , whiteness as an oppressive system would not exist . with the racial caste system , at the opposite of the whiteness we were taught to aspire to ( blond hair , straightened hair , impossible slim frames , european features , etc . ) was blackness , lower on the hierarchy than indigeneity . our african was and is seen as shameful even more so than our indigeneity . even so , both anti-blackness and anti-indigeneity are intrinsic on islands marked by racial hierarchies and both are vital in order for the system to continue to harm our communities who readily still accept racial hierarchies within the island and outside of it . for this reason , in order to knock them down along my own lineage , i purposely began to exclude the colonizer in us from my identity to decenter it and boldly centered the africanness alongside our taino ancestry . once i left the island , i witnessed and understood the ways in which black and indigenous people were and are further fragmented on the “ mainland ” through the same system our ancestors were forced to endure and through lateral violence . the system purposely created and creates confusion about our own identities within our own communities and in the way we are understood by those from other marginalized groups . on turtle island , the british colonizers ’ caste is one where you are either black or white . we , boricuas , were treated as others , until whiteness understood it could exploit our colonial past and further decenter our blackness and indigeneity in an attempt to entice boricuas with the whiteness that will never understand or respect us— and yet , somehow have as exemplified by u.s. census forms through the last 100 years . in a way , this is why so many of us have lost our direct paths to our ancestors despite knowing we are african , taino , and iberian . this , however , did not occur out of shame but out of survival , especially upon becoming yet another colony under settler u.s. laws beginning in 1898 . the reality was we had been handed over to yet another violent european enforced society where segregation , lynching , and other abuses were the norm they forced on us by ignoring our indigeneity while deciding on our merit according to the one drop rule and paper bag test along descendants of enslaved africans forced to the mainland by british europeans . we had been poisoned by spanish colonialism , and our new owners exercised the power they now had over us by ensuring even those on the mainland understood what our place was as they bombed our people , erased our fight for independence , and made our flags illegal , and further emphasized that we , and everything about us , lacked worth as mixed-race people whose identity had merged into one influenced by both blackness and indigeneity . i spent years understanding my internalized anti-blackness as the child of a black-skinned dominican born on borikén . it had taken me a long time to understand the rage of african americans upon my stating my identity as proudly boricua . the rage and wall between our communities i now clearly understand is due to the anti-blackness that so many boricuas and dominicans , particularly in the taino reconnecting movement refuse to acknowledge and work on . they have witnessed how those of us with lighter skin privileges chose to forsake our african ancestors for a higher place on the hierarchy they have always been at the bottom of . unfortunately , anti-indigeneity within the african american community has also meant that settlers have been able to weaponize identity between us . we ’ re so busy committed to the system that we failed to acknowledge that our struggles are interconnected and against the same system . as for our own people , the spanish and other europeans ensured they erased our traditions , ceremonies , and even our identities as non-gendered people . they made people like me , two spirit people , disappear from existence . the british successfully achieved the same . and through their own racialized hierarchies , attempted to uproot and silently genocide the native out of anyone whose land they wanted across turtle island . indigenous communities on the mainland were also forced to abandon their traditions and were thrown into a disarray when blood quantum , or how indigenous someone was according to white settlers rules , overtook their own community identities . the years i spent on mainland turtle island taught me that i had to understand that the word boricua , people made up of black , native , and colonizer mixed through a 400 year old battle , meant something completely different outside the island . i had to understand my privileges even as a brown skinned boricua in order to understand my experiences as they intertwined with my own ancestry and how a double colonized history shaped us . this would all lead me to understand how this same conflict occurred in communities that identified under my same ethnicity across parts of turtle island i have never even been to . life on the mainland u.s. somehow led me to spending over a decade in europe . i can say i have felt colonialism at its roots in all its suffocating violence . living amongst europeans , experiencing culture across various countries , i finally understood them as inherently violent , individualistic , and empty , incapable of understanding nature or spirit beyond materialism . europe was the very opposite of the warm , community-minded , friendly , welcoming people i grew up with and came from . these , my people , were descendants of the taino . suddenly , columbus ’ own words describing the taino as kind , good people to take advantage of made sense from a people who do not seem to understand warmth , kindness , or community . of course , the things they lacked would be the most notable they wrote back to home about and the ones that allowed them to pillage our lives for centuries . while in europe , i actively sought to understand myself in the context of a continent that was foreign to me and yet , whose blood somehow also ran through me . after all , how could i ( or anyone ) decolonize if we do not understand what we are decolonizing from ? in the same way , how can we reconnect without understanding what it means to disconnect and from what ? i stood at the very real steps of the original slave market that shipped our enslaved african ancestors from the portuguese coast to the caribbean . i shared space with canarian people that sounded just like boricuas on the island and watched their own colonization through garitas exactly like the ones in san juan . i contained my inner rage as i strolled past the gold dipped castle that houses spainish royalty still 500 years after they genocided us for that very gold that simply sits there watching them continue to thrive while barely remembering our exploited , impoverished existence . as i studied invasive species in ireland for my masters degree , i understood otherization and dehumanization of those like me and how my identity became whatever community they saw in my unusual features according to the racialized group they hated most . as i celebrated holidays for years in germany , i understood my lack of worth as a two spirit being and understood the depth of sexism on the continent it came from . the same taught me what unashamed , emboldened murder inspired by native genocide looked like as i walked through the gas chambers of dachau . i witnessed the faux politeness and unspoken , expected order from the paper thin lips of british people , too in detached from reality to acknowledge the violence they have spread across the entire world . while i awaited my return back home from switzerland , i learned individuality and bullying as the tactic used to climb ladders above those deemed weak . i learned what excess and uncaring power looks like and at what cost and to whom . europe taught me violence , rejection , and oppression at the source . it ’ s people taught me that , while pieces of their culture may taint my blood , my indigeniety and blackness won the battle . they are the ones that make up the people of borikén still 500 years after europeans polluted our ways of life . they are the flavor to our soul . they are the divine that allow the sun to kiss my skin without harm . they are the joy that naturally existed in my heart since birth . i came from good people that , despite all , were and are still good people . more than good people , we are descendants of survivors and warriors . i returned home feeling confident enough to reject the forced iberian/european , which has never and will never recognize me as an entire person , once and for good . i had come full circle in recognizing first-hand the system that exploited , destroyed , depleted , and erased my african and indigenous ancestors . i had fully decolonized from the hierarchies and blanqueamiento still expected and tolerated on the island — and in u.s. settler society through the demonization of both my blackness and indigeneity . i was grateful to finally settle back home , but i knew i still had a lot of work to do in my continual decolonization . i found myself looking to natives i befriended and felt a special connection with . through my travels and activism , i crossed passed with natives from gadigal , oneida , and mi ’ kmaw tribes . in learning about them , their teachings , and community , i hoped i could reconnect with my own . i nervously asked my mi ’ kmaw contact , the person that had taught me the word “ two spirit ” , what they thought would be expected in an introduction letter to a tribe i had looked into . unfortunately , i received word from another taino that the tribe no longer seemed to be active , so i turned to social media for taino spaces . it didn ’ t take long to encounter spaces more resembling of european communities than my own island and people . this was the last of what i expected : shaming , bullying , gossiping/spreading rumors of individuals , gatekeeping , silencing , exclusion , and exploiting power above other marginalized members deemed lower on the colonizer hierarchy ( such as disabled people , two spirit people , people with mental health problems , etc ) . these forms of lateral violence ( more via creative spirits/j . korffs 2020 & 2021 ) greeted me from the moment i attempted to connect with others as i sought to learn about myself through the knowledge of those who unapologetically embraced our taino ancestry . what became quite clear was that i was experiencing spaces reproducing internalized colonialism in the name of decolonization and reconnection . the most blatant of these was the constant fight for power over authenticity — who and what “ tribe ” is the most taíno of all . “ we ’ re the one true tribe ” “ we ’ re the first and best ” “ we ’ re the most authentic ” “ you ’ re nobody in this community ” “ just because you were born in borikén , doesn ’ t make you taíno ” taino reconnecting spaces became a real-life lesson in the effects of blood quantum mixed with internalized colonialism as i watched reconnecting people either make believe ignoring blatant lateral violence is enlighten meant or the opposite , actively participate in lateral oppression unashamedly . i sought safe spaces in which i could learn more about myself as a two spirit person and death healer and walked out of taino reconnecting spaces feeling like i did when i felt trapped and suffocated by my experiences across the european continent . as i write , taino reconnecting spaces are not community spaces . they are drenched with colonial reproductions attempting to dictate who is worthy and who is not worthy of recognizing their taino ancestors while ignoring all the intricacies that make caribbean people who they are and the influences that have shaped those born and raised on the islands and those living one , two , or even three generations in the diaspora . some of the worst experiences i have had in taino spaces relate to the constant ableism/neuroableism in taino spaces . the insistence in upholding binarism , misgendering , and filing two spirit people under “ women ” despite the common knowledge that taino communities did not follow european gender binaries is also all too common . even worse is the patriarchal insistence that two spirit assigned males under settler society would be the determiners of how the rest of us should identify — as women . both are forms of lateral violence that the majority of groups i have been in seem completely unaware of . in addition , while language is an important way communities can be brought together , even this is being used as one of the most toxic forms of lateral violence polluting the taino reconnection movement . those in the diaspora are somehow deciding the one true language for all of us . even columbus affirmed that , “ …from bahama to cuba , boriken to jamaica , the same language was spoken in various slight dialects , but understood by all. ” therefore , especially for a language that has had to be reconstructed ( some choosing to do so based on white interpretations that apparently hold more weight because “ scholars ” and others through languages unconnected through centuries upon centuries while both look down on the taino already integrated as part of reconnection in borikén ) , the idea that one can only be taino if embracing the same exact path as everyone else , is not only privileged , ableist , and classist but is also actually erases our ancestors . the arrogance of claiming to be the “ one ” , true , only , first , is nothing more than internalized colonialism and lateral violence . during an introductory meeting for a tribe i wanted to familiarize myself with , a cacique claimed that one can not decolonize if one does not learn to think in their native language . this statement , however , can not be further from the reality of what is means to decolonize . one can learn any language they choose , but if they do not understand decolonization through a consistent anti-oppressive , multi-faceted lens willing to begin the journey within the individual , then they will simply continue to uphold colonialism while failing to detach from the very system they claim to want to in their native language . native language within communities that reproduce and allow unchecked ableism , neuroableism , sexism , binarism , homophobia , transphobia , classism , anti-blackness , etc . is still colonialism . a native that maliciously excludes , bullies , shames , and silences is still colonialism . leaders who allow lateral violence to continue are modern soldiers of colonialism . the only ones that benefit from our fragmentation , in-fighting , competition , self-oppression , and inability to build community outside of these are the descendants of the settlers that attempted to extinguish us . it is imperative that the taino reconnecting movement understand that silence and not addressing lateral violence is literally a tool of colonialism that oppressed people reproduce in order to ensure they too control those they deem beneath them . lateral violence is a tool of colonialism . what isn ’ t lateral violence ? i can affirm that asking questions , openly challenging oppression , addressing issues and disagreements openly , making an effort to build communities together without hierarchies , excluding settlers while rebuilding , accepting language as dialects rather as one true one , sharing knowledge openly , educating rather than shaming , accepting our differences , making a point to address micro-oppressive systems ( ableism , binarism , anti-blackness , etc . ) is to oppose lateral violence as a start . decolonization without community is colonialism . community can not exist as it once did by reproducing the same violence that we have been forced to live under for 500 years . 2 . why is language being touted as the sole way decolonization happens ? 3 . why are the different tribes so disconnected to the point that they do not have any awareness of previous and already established language reconstruction projects ? 4 . how is one person more taino than another if both have taino blood in their veins ? who decided this ? 5 . what exactly is the common goal of the taino community ? 6 . do you understand the difference between open communication/the unwillingness to follow unquestionably and disrespect ? 7 . when do we talk about this all as a community ? 8 . do you understand that gatekeeping is paper genocide and only serves settlers to benefit from exclusion ? so many more questions but these are a good place to start working to eradicate the masters ’ tools once and for all . -copyright julia feliz 2022- i

reddit_antiracist_31152,"it depends on where you live , but if you happen to be in one of the cities passing toothless reforms , ask for details on how they 're going to be enforced . 

 for example , i live in minneapolis , and one of the reforms they recently passed is requiring cops to fill out forms explaining what they did to de - escalate a situation before they used force . however , one of the big criticisms early on with george floyd was that the way cops on the scene described the event in reports did not accurately reflect what happened . ( they called it a "" medical event "" while conveniently leaving out the part where they deprived a man 's brain of oxygen for almost 9 minutes . ) 

 what is going to keep police from creating self - serving narratives on these new forms , too ? will there be mechanisms to catch cops who do this , or will be still be depending on bystander video to expose the truth ? what will those mechanisms be and how will they work ? if there are no planned mechanisms to catch cops who massage the truth to suit their interests , how is this any more than an empty gesture framed as reform ?",reddit_antiracist
medium_antiracist_11967,"robert charles , one of the realest niggas in history the year was 1900 , long before trayvon martin , mike brown , sandra bland , tamir rice , korryn gaines , and alton sterling even existed . two black men sat on a doorstep in new orleans and talked . their names were robert charles and leonard pierce . they weren ’ t far from home . there was no crime afoot , no law being broken — except the unwritten one — existing while black . two officers approached them , and “ approached ” is putting it lightly , for this was 1900 , before the readily available cameras and halfway implied accountability . one officer quickly pointed his gun at pierce , the other assaulted robert charles . this is where things took a turn . the officer drew his gun to shoot him , but our hero drew his own gun . they shot each other . robert charles took a shot to the leg , but the officer was wounded terribly . homeboy was now wanted for shooting and wounding a cop . sure it was self defense , but negroes aren ’ t supposed to defend themselves . they are second class citizens who should keel over and die when told to . charles had the option of turning himself in and possibly making his case , but success of that for a black man was — and still today is — about as likely as a fish jumping out of the ocean and walking on land . pierce was taken into custody , and the officer who exchanged bullets with charles was taken into care . the mainstream media operated similarly to how they do today , defending the cops , and vilifying the black individuals . one paper talked about how the neighborhood it occurred in had been “ troubled with bad negroes. ” not one questioned the officer ’ s account or used context to understand why a black person would fear for their life in 1900 new orleans . the hunt began : there was no scenario where robert charles could come in alive . none . the advertisement might as well saved a bit of money on ink and omitted the “ or alive ” part . the police had intent on shooting and killing this man on sight . robert charles was fully aware of this , however . police captain day showed up to charles ’ s house , where charles hid , ready to fight to the death . day didn ’ t last long , he rushed towards charles ’ s room , determined to put him down . charles shot him dead . another officer approached , but charles shot him dead too . the remaining cops hid . later , they found courage to attempt their assault on charles ’ s residence once more , only to find he had escaped during their downtime . meanwhile , things were getting ugly in the surrounding area . a violent mob of white people formed . some black folks were arrested for demonstrating . one of them was thought to be robert charles , as the mob viciously beat him outside the police station . his face was unrecognizable after the affair . it ’ s a good thing black lives don ’ t matter , as some type of accountability might have been inflicted on the police or said mob if that were the case ! the mob grew in size , and it didn ’ t look like it was going to stop anytime soon . the mayor of kenner came to speak to them , and his words were words of a barbarian : that ’ s right . pierce , who hadn ’ t shot anyone or done anything at all , was now made a target . the mob went to the parish prison , but they wouldn ’ t give pierce up . i ’ m sure they had their own plans for him . this only frustrated the mob more , and they grew even more violent . black people in the vicinity who didn ’ t even look like robert charles were beaten savagely , only to appease the frustrations of the crowd . one man was chased by the mob , and people from the crowd yelled things like “ we will get a nigger down here , you bet ! ” he was shot several times and killed . in another occurrence , a 75 year old black man was shot by the mob and killed . he was on the way to his job in the french market . black men and women were shot and killed whenever they made an appearance near these mobs . an old black woman named hannah mabry was shot in the lung and killed in her own home . no arrests . black lives didn ’ t matter . robert charles was holed up in a small building not too far away from his home . he was still wounded , and likely knew his chances of escape were low , with mobs everywhere and every single officer in new orleans craving his blood . 2 officers walked inside the building and quickly after , 2 officers laid shot . charles moved to the upper part of the building , with bullets later raining into the house . charles kept his cool and popped up in one of the 4 windows every now then and took shots at his pursuers . while many papers at the time called him a “ black fiend , ” they seemed quite impressed with his accuracy with a gun . the times-democrat wrote : after several bullets exchanged between the bloodthirsty crowd and charles , they realized they had to play by different rules . the plan was simple : set the building on fire . the mob put the plan into action , and it worked . they set an old mattress on fire , and fire soon met the structure of the building . charles understood that he had to get out of there , or he ’ d burn alive , so he headed back towards the bottom floor . the crowd fired a barrage of bullets at the building , hoping to get lucky , but none of them hit . making his escape through the rear , rifle in hand , he shot at one of his pursuers guarding the back and slightly missed . before he could shoot at him again , the pursuer shot his revolver at him and our hero met his death . the crowd dumped bullets into his corpse , to the point where you couldn ’ t tell that a human once laid there . and for that matter , that humans once stood over it holding guns . in the aftermath , fines were handed out . edward mccarthy , a white man , who arrived only four days since from new york , went to the scene of the excitement at the corner of third and rampart streets , and told the negroes that they were as good as any white man . this remark was made by mccarthy , as another white man said the negroes should be lynched . mccarthy told the recorder that he considered a negro as good as a white in body and soul . he was fined $ 25 or thirty days . all the negroes and whites who were arrested in the vicinity of tuesday ’ s tragedy had a hard time before recorder hughes yesterday . lee jackson was the first prisoner , and the evidence established that he made his way to the vicinity of the crime and told his negro friends that he thought a good many more policemen ought to be killed . jackson said he was drunk when he made the remark . he was fined $ 25 or thirty days . matilda gamble was arrested by the police for saying that two officers were killed and it was a pity more were not shot . she was given $ 25 or thirty days . shoutout to lee , matilda , and edward . as some of us sit in shock and horror that a misogynistic white supremacist now leads the country , it ’ s important to remember where this country came from . it ’ s important to understand that this type of stuff went on . and it ’ s important to recognize robert charles , who died defending himself against white supremacy , as one of the realest niggas in history . under the authority vested in me by law , i hereby offer , in the name ofthe city of new orleans , $ 250 reward for the capture and delivery , deador alive , to the authorities of the city , the body of the negromurderer , robert charles . “ i am from kenner , gentlemen , and i have come down to new orleans tonight to assist you in teaching the blacks a lesson . i have killed a negro before , and in revenge of the wrong wrought upon you and yours , i am willing to kill again . the only way that you can teach these niggers a lesson and put them in their place is to go out and lynch a few of them as an object lesson . string up a few of them , and the others will trouble you no more . that is the only thing to do — kill them , string them up , lynch them ! i will lead you , if you will but follow . on to the parish prison and lynch pierce ! ” his wonderful marksmanship never failed him for a moment , and when he missed , it was always by the narrowest margin only .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_42947,"dear marley , thank you , again , for your wisdom , passion , insight and clarity . your writing is a gift to your readers . i am thinking of another essay i read on medium . the thesis was that racism is so woven into the american fabric , that any attempt to challenge or change it risks being labeled as un-american . my thesis is that white supremacy , and all forms of bigotry and oppression , have a lineage , and a genesis , and that lineage and genesis trace in all cases to ( 1 ) the few and the strong being able to oppress the weak and ( 2 ) the few and the strong using these tactics to divide the many by making one subset of the servant classes dominant over the other as a way for the masters to maintain their dominance over all and ( 3 ) a mythos that some are more deserving than others of access to the means to achieve and sustain life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . our freedoms to behave in an antisocial manner towards each other and those with lesser social standing are sold to white america as the means by which they are more free . but the truth is that they are the pretext and rationale for the predation of the few on the many . from the mid-seventies onward , productivity , the amount of wealth produced per hour of labor , has been constantly rising . however , real wages as a proportion of the wealth produced by that labor have declined . the american working class has , as a whole , been working harder , longer , and more productively , while falling farther behind . i don ’ t think that it is any surprise that many white americans react the way that they do when being asked to acknowledge white privilege and systemic racism in this context . because the structure of the relationship to the larger power structure means that any increased share of wealth and social standing by the subordinate groups is going to come out of their already unjustly diminished share . through their eyes , their share of the american dream is ( a ) the product of their hard work and sacrifice and ( b ) already under threat by social forces they don ’ t understand so they are informed by right-wing media and commentary . they are being asked to acknowledge privledge at a point in history where they are not feeling very privledged at all . i don ’ t think it is possible to defeat white supremacy without enlisting the majority of white people in that fight . i don ’ t think that appeals to interracial justice are sufficient to do the job . we have to convince enough white americans that although nonwhites may suffer disproportionately from white supremacy , they are also its victims . the virginia race laws , that codified white supremacy in the early 1700s , assured whites of certain advantages over their erstwhile companions in servitude . they would always be the overseers . they would always get to keep their shirts on when if they got whipped . but those laws also codified a social relationship of who held the whip hand over all . that so many of their descendants can ’ t see that plain fact three centuries later is an enduring shame . but i also know enough about shame to know that is not how people learn or change . and learn and change we must , not just for the futures of nonwhite peoples , but also for our own . white supremacy ’ s legacy makes nonwhites more susceptible to covid-19 , lack of access to housing , jobs , education , health care , enfranchisement , environmental justice , the list goes on . those increased and unjust burdens imperil us all . the virus won ’ t limit itself to the jails , detention camps , meat processing factories , homeless encampments , or minority neighborhoods . the districts with the highest rates of minority voter suppression have the highest rates of white poverty . the competition being more fair does not make the overall system that forces us to compete with each other for survival any less unfair or unsustainable . lilla watson writes , “ if you have come here to help me you are wasting your time , but if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine , then let us work together. ” i know that my white skin , gender and other intersectionally-dominant identities have unjustly afforded me many rights and privledges that i take for granted at the expense of you and others who do not share those identities . and the fact of that differential being normalized in our society makes me less free . i believe my liberation is inextricably bound up with yours . thank you for your poetry and prose , your heart , your mind , your hands , and your story . ben",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_34099,"why white liberals and progressives love donald trump there has been ( too ) much discussion about how donald trump is the patron saint of white supremacy . and despite getting hammered in the press about it , he just does not back down . these are his beliefs , no matter how politically incorrect or offensive , and that ’ s what he ’ s sticking to . so far , it ’ s been successful within the republican party . he ’ s gotten farther than anyone lucid would have ever imagined . my guess is his ride comes to an abrupt , screeching halt on tuesday evening . trump ’ s unbridled nastiness and policies designed to “ make america great again ” is manna from heaven and a longed-for catharsis for his most ardent supporters : uber-conservative white people who long for an america of yesteryear , when lives were segregated and people knew their “ place. ” a place where , to his supporters , “ law and order ” prevailed . but you know who really loves donald trump ? white liberals and progressives . yes , you read that correctly . that ’ s not a typo . he ’ s the best thing to happen to them since sliced five-grain , gluten-free , vegan bread . why is this ? it is because he provides them with cover for their own more temperate , but also very loathsome version of racism . there is a racism problem among progressives . sorry to be the bearer of bad yet obvious news . the supposed shock , amazement and offense that many white liberals have met donald trump with is disingenuous , when they all know trumps in their lives . and far too many white liberals and progressives practice a more oleaginous brand of racism themselves . the loud pronouncements on social media of “ if you are a trump supporter-unfriend me now ! ! ! ” ring hollow when every thanksgiving or family gathering these same people sit across the table from family members who spew racist epithets and garbage about people of color and they say absolutely nothing , rationalizing it with “ that ’ s just uncle mike ’ s generation. ” they then get on a plane home to their gentrified neighborhood and complain about uncle mike and how “ not like him ” him they are in the safe cocoon of their friends social media that remind them how “ good ” a person they are for not being like uncle mike . phew ! until next year… when handed the chance to address it directly — and take a social risk — many of these same liberals and progressive fail over and over again with their resolute silence in the face of racism . they are silent at family gatherings . they are silent at work . they are silent on the train . and they are silent online . as they say , silence is consent . though not as social media-ready , these real-life spaces are the ones that matter and where the small , risky , daily battles necessary to end racism are won and lost . how many times have you as a person of color been in a social situation and something racist happen and your good white liberal/progressive friend say nothing and impotently and mutely stare into their drink ? and then tell you — after you ’ ve had to bear the burden of being both the victim and the one that rights the wrong — how awful that person was ? long after their window for real action has passed ? but they ’ ll be at the anti-trump rally standing next to you yelling louder than anyone and excoriating trump for likes and posting protest selfies on social media . these are the same white liberals and progressives that disproportionately populate the top ranks of non-profits , schools and social service organizations ( organizations where our own numbers are extremely high ) , terrorizing and thwarting the progress of so many people of color that work under them but never self-examining because they are “ good people doing important work. ” so many sisters and brothers who are also “ good people doing important personal work ” are demoralized at these organizations by these very people . i can ’ t tell you how many friends of mine i ’ ve dried their tears , and listened to them as they recount their trips to the therapist , turn to drink or drug to cope with the racism they experience at the hands of supposed allies . these friends are victims of the emotional , structural and symbolic violence that they experience at the hands of white , but racist , do-gooders . as a sociologist , i am extremely mindful that personal anecdotes are not data , however , i am still stunned with just how many i ’ ve heard and experienced about how dismissive , racist and cruel that many of these liberal spaces and people can be . and that daily structural and symbolic violence is not caused by people who identify with and support trump . just the opposite . but as long as the trumps of the world are spotlighted there ’ s a beacon of fetid light that they can point at and say “ see , he ’ s the racist . i ’ m not like him ! ! ! ! , ” thus providing cover for continuation . and i watch as one race-based murder after another feature on traditional and social media , i also watch as many of these same white progressive liberals friends are silent . when confronted they claim “ my social media is not political , i just use it to keep in touch family and friends. ” but suddenly with the ascension of trump their pages have suddenly turned into a volunteer arm of clinton campaign . and now they want to talk about racism , but only in relation to trump . “ trump is racist ! i ’ m so offended by trump ’ s racism . you ’ d better be too ! ! ! racist ! racist ! racist ! vote blue ! ! ! we are the ones standing between you and slavery . you ’ d better vote blue or else… “ or else what ? there is an expectation of complete and total fealty , with nothing given in return except another chance to do a shaky , humiliating buck dance on the precipice of threatened re-enslavement should they so decide ? until next time at the polls… excuse my skepticism , but would many of these people be talking about racism if there wasn ’ t something in it for them ( a vote for their candidate of choice attached ) ? probably not if their mute history with uncle mike , their normally apolitical social media pages or your daily life with them outside of election season at thanksgiving is any guide . i also watch when my black friends , so hopeful to find anchor and allyship in this cruel world , get into needless , emotionally violent “ debates ” with their white liberal “ friends ” to try to “ educate ” and explain racism and police brutality over and over again to them to no avail . we ’ ve been fed the lie that if we just explain it right , they ’ ll get it , which puts the onus on us to “ impress ” them . it is a lie designed to make you feel powerful , as you engage in not only draining your own power , but adding to theirs . it is a net-negative , sick dance that upholds the myth and again , provides the racist white progressive with cover . this is a fool ’ s errand if there ever was one . maybe they have no intention of getting it , after all , they are good people and trump is the racist . what ’ s to fix ? ask amy schumer . and then rinse , lather and repeat when the next instance of police-sanctioned race-based murder or whatever race-based incident arises , usually within a few days . we never seem to be able to cut the cord , perhaps in large part because it means cutting off access lies about racism as a culture war , rather than what it really is , a rights and dignity war that has to be legislated away , not talked away . this is a myth that we as black folk cuddled up to our whole lives like a security blanket woven in soft , poisonous comforting lies . nobody wants to believe in the american myth of good whiteness more than black folk , otherwise we ’ d have to admit our situation is even bleaker than we feared , and those that trust and love as friends aren ’ t always allies when it matters most . it ’ s a lonely place to be , but a necessary place to understand so it can be corrected , or at the very least , we can protect ourselves . this anti-trump , colorless progressive unity , will end on tuesday night when he most likely loses . and then we , as black folk , should quietly go back to shaky standing ? no . we recognize racism ( both the right and left version ) , call it out and say “ enough ” to racism on both sides in our daily lives . we cut the cord . even with our “ friends ” if need be . in a rudderless world , when the seas are so violent and rough , cutting this cord seems like suicide . i argue that its self-care and freedom from the burden of carrying the liberal version of racism that , in our spaces that we inhabit daily , is so odious and damaging . that cord is full of razors and thorns . stop the bleeding . i ’ ll put in the requisite , “ not all white progressives ” here , but really progressive white folk people reading this would not have needed that to feel comfortable with what i ’ m saying . ahem . and they would have also known long before this essay that there is a racism problem on the left . exposing it is the first step in correcting it . denying it or employing a comparative lens to it ( trump is worse ! ) is not helpful in eradicating it . and that is something that we all — white , black , brown and everywhere in between — are doing . hiding behind trump is not the answer . if we want a progressive agenda for this country , we ’ ve all got to begin to practice within our own ranks , and daily lives before disseminating it as a viable alternative for the country . for many white liberals and progressives , donald trump is the world ’ s greatest gift : an orange camouflage against their own prejudices , failures and infantilization of people of color , most egregiously in my opinion , the black community . and conversely people of color have a bogeyman that they can point to as the architect of modern-day racism . in a world so uncertain where racism comes at you from angles you never even knew existed , it is comforting , yet misleading , to be able to clearly identify it in its orange , unkempt , inarticulate glory . for this election period , the myth of the “ racist as easily identifiable bad person ” is one that both white liberals and black folk have gotten drunk on and linked arm-in-arm to condemn in this election season . how sad it will be , and how very predictable , when the day after the election when they find the bogeyman might be the very one that were holding hands with the day before .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_4585,"i think trying to make a distinction between ‘ discrimination ’ and ‘ racism ’ makes sense psychologically , semantically and in some principles of justice because of the concept of intent . however , if you ’ re saying that racism is dependent on racist intent , that becomes less tenable as we become more familiar with the history of racism in the world . i also think what you ’ re talking about is building positive interpersonal relationships — being good to each other , respecting one another , the one-on-ones factors in being good people , which we desperately need in this day and age . intent however , like i said , the history of racism is basically littered with good intentions . aboriginal australia in particular has a shocking history of government programs of good intentions , based on science considered valid and a considered ethical viewpoint of learned men — just like incidents in the usa . this very calm and measured process does not make it immune to huge atrocities , no matter how objective those people thought they were being . the balance of power in the world today is a result of the history of the world — of conquest and forcible invasion of other countries by western europe . racist beliefs , which importantly were not thought to be racist , just natural and scientific , was a cornerstone of the justification of this process . the current world is built on this foundation and you can see the ripples in , for example , african and south american statehood . structures & racism your original assertion was that a shirt can ’ t be racist . i think what you might mean is that a pile of non-sentient cotton fibres can ’ t be racist . it ’ s not going to be yelling at a chinese person on the street to go home . this is pretty obvious and i agree . but the provenance of the material and the method of its manufacture have to take place in a complex world of finance , culture and history . why , for example , are we talking about a shirt ? why are we not talking about a kurta or sherwani ? why is the company situated in the usa and not in africa ? why is it manufactured in asia and not in europe ? this isn ’ t to denigrate the usa . it ’ s been a really awesome source of so many amazing inventions and clever thinking . but i think without considering why it is this way and not that , we have no chance to move forward as a human group .",medium_antiracist

medium_antiracist_20035,"a discussion of the ‘ religion and worldviews in religious education ’ report : critical race theory first , i want to highlight the significance of the ‘ religion and worldviews ’ report ( commission on religious education 2018 ) ⁠ — for what is a very timely and important intervention in the teaching of religion in english and welsh schools . as the authors make note in the report , the social and cultural environment has changed very considerably since 1988 , when the last major reform of re happened . it is hard even to imagine ourselves back to that late-thatcher and post-scarman and falklands world , and the immense changes that have happened across the uk in the decades since . and as a note to this , the need for reform of religious education in scotland is also very pressing — as a university lecturer turned rmps teacher recently pointed out on twitter , there is a 20-year time lag between the teaching of the subject in schools compared to universities . there is definitely a need for change — although with the present uk government and the challenges of the coronavirus i am not sure if now is actually the time for such change . but there is definitely a necessity to think about the needs of society today and onwards to the next few decades . i must stress that i am not a teacher of religious education , although this is something i have been giving a lot of thought to — in short , i would not wish to teach re or rmps in its current forms . my position is that the system and in particular the curriculum is in need of reform , as with much of the teaching in humanities across the various uk education systems . if the current black lives matter movement in the uk is to have a lasting impact , it is in the recognition and opening up of the school curricular to colonial history and black history , to more honestly educate students and prepare them for the world and the societies in which they live . much comes down to the key question of : or why should it be taught ? or even , are there more important subjects to be teaching instead ? this often comes back to questions of morals , values , etc — whether these are specific faith-group values or otherwise generic values ( such as ‘ british values ’ ) . and of course there is a growing movement to promote the development of religious literacy — a well meaning , but rather under theorised term . that is , if ‘ religion ’ is going to be on the school curriculum and in the school structures , the starting question is : what is it that we are wanting to teach ? and within that , what is being missed out ( either accidently or otherwise ) ? the scholar and activist prof angela y. davis is often quoted as saying : as we have seen over the last few months , there are many ways to interpret the phrase ‘ anti-racist ’ , but i would relate this in particular to the ( recently maligned ) approach of critical race theory . some key aspects of this are : the point of this is to challenge and change — by recognizing the problems , and alongside that by implementing new policies and systems that can break the cycles of racialized inequality and violence . as i have said elsewhere , this is not about ‘ making room at the table ’ , it is about redefining the whole room ( nye 2019 ) ⁠ . this is , of course , where education comes in . i agree with ornette clennon ( 2018 ) ⁠ , that much of the present education system is about inculcating the ideology and practice of whiteness ( and thus racialized power structures ) in students . anti-racist education requires us to challenge and change this , and of course to examine the structures and curricular that reproduce the power structures of whiteness . thus , if — as scholars and/or teachers — we are not talking about race , then we can not be anti-racist . the problem won ’ t go away by not addressing the problem . by failing to acknowledge the prevalence of race and racialization ( and of course racism ) all our good efforts are failing to deliver an education process that challenges structural and institutional racism . as revell and elton-chalcraft argue : i must add , that i can not find any part of the religion and worldviews 2018 report that either directly or indirectly addresses the need for anti-racist education . indeed , like many other humanities subjects , the study of religion ( including the teaching of religious education ) seems to make a particular point of implying or celebrating diversity but not talking about race , even though the subject area is itself heavily racialized . here the point goes back to a fairly old discussion between ‘ multicultural ’ and ‘ anti-racist ’ education ( fry 1986 ) , ⁠ where ( despite the best efforts of writers such as hall [ 2000 ] , ⁠ the emphasis of the former ( i.e. , multiculturalism ) is on understanding and encouraging tolerance of difference , whilst for the latter the emphasis is on addressing and changing structures of power . thus , as an example , in the framing of contemporary re ( where non-christian religions are taught ) , the assumptions of the existence of the ‘ big six ’ ‘ world religions ’ refer to what could be called the orphans of empire : the traditions that british imperialism classified as the ones to know . to use the phrase that i often quote from patrick wolfe ( 2016 ) ⁠ , such racialisation is clearly ‘ colonialism speaking ’ within and as the present system . thus , there is very little in the teaching of religion that actually addresses britain ’ s history of race and colonialism . much of the recent blm movement and the decolonising calls for reform have focused on teaching of history — that is , giving students a literacy and understanding of the history of slavery , colonialism , and black british history ( see , in particular , the black curriculum , nd ) . that is good in itself , but has perhaps let re teachers ( and university scholars ) off the hook . the topic of religious education is also fruit from that same poisonous tree . we can not and should not teach and research religion without a thorough grounding in how the topic of religion is a racialized concept that emerged from european ( particularly british and american ) colonial history . we should also be aware that there is an apparent ( white ) innocence ( wekker 2016 ) ⁠ of the discipline concerning race , and that there is often a seeming surprise that studies of religion become meaningful through critical race theory . the prevailing ( ideological ) discourse in british society is that somehow religion usually stands above and separate from more mundane issues such as race , discrimination ( and thus power and economics ) . in fact , issues of race and colonialism are hidden in plain sight . there are of course examples of good practice within the teaching of re in both england and wales , and also within scotland , that go against this grain . after all , as far back as 1986 , the educationalist carol fry ( 1986 ) ⁠ asked ( but didn ’ t answer ) the diffifcult question is religious education ‘ a racist subject ? ’ . and recent studies of anti-racist education have highlighted , for example , the ways that issues of discrimination and racial hatred are sometimes tackled directly in re or rmps classes ( revell and elton-chalcraft 2016 ; eis 2018 , 5 ) . these include in particular subjects such as the holocaust and anti-semitism , and in some instances islamophobia ( even sometimes as a form of anti-muslim racism , as defined in the recent runnymede trust ( 2017 , 1 ) ⁠ report . i would also recommend a recent collection of papers edited by jacoby and tinklenberg ( 2018 ) that explicitly explores the teaching of race and religion , albeit from a us context and specifically concerned with teaching in higher education . there is also a wealth of scholarship on the theoretical , historical , and practical connections between the categories of race and religion ( weisenfeld 2016 ; mctighe 2020 ; goodwin 2020 ; vial 2016 ; lloyd 2013 ; newton 2019 ; miller and driscoll 2019 ; nye 2018 ) .⁠ what is very noticeable , however , is that very little of this research has become embedded within british-based studies of religion . to conclude , i recently set out a short paper here on religion bites , which outlined what i saw of some of the implications of such an approach , that is , what i see as starting points to discuss and teach religion from this perspective . my thoughts clustered under 6/7 broad headers — some of which will already be familiar . indeed , these are intended just as a starting point , and of course build on a large body of theory and practice that has been in the process of development for several decades . these are : in conclusion , what i am exploring is a way to further address the challenges of teaching religion ( and worldviews ) as an anti-racist/critical race theory contribution to the curriculum . a significant part of this is learning how to develop a mode of ‘ religious literacy ’ that embeds a ‘ racial literacy ’ . there is a very significant need to give students a way of talking about race and issues of racism — this is something that has been made very clear within the discussions of summer 2020 , following the killing in the us of george floyd . if anti-racism is not going to be taught as a specific subject within british educational systems , then re is an important place in which this can and should happen . references : black curriculum . n.d. “ the black curriculum : our curriculum. ” 2020 . accessed september 6 , 2020. https : //www.theblackcurriculum.com/ourcurriculum . clennon , ornette d. 2018 . black scholarly activism between the academy and grassroots : a bridge for identities and social justice . london : palgrave . commission on religious education . 2018 . “ religion and worldviews : the way forward . a national plan for re. ” london . https : //www.commissiononre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/final-report-of-the-commission-on-re.pdf . eis . 2018 . briefing : anti-racist education . a report by the educational institute of scotland . https : //www.eis.org.uk/anti-racism/briefingantiracisteducation fry , carol . 1986 . “ religious education : a racist subject ?

 a model minority is a demographic group ( whether based on ethnicity , race or religion ) whose members are perceived to achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success than the population average . this success is typically measured relatively by income , education , low criminality and high family / marital stability . the concept is controversial , as it has historically been used to suggest there is no need for government action to adjust for socioeconomic disparities between certain groups . generalized statistics are often cited to back up model minority status such as high educational achievement and a high representation in white collar professions . a common misconception is that the affected communities usually hold pride in their labeling as the model minority . the model minority stereotype is considered detrimental to relevant minority communities because it is used to justify the exclusion of minorities in the distribution of assistance programs , both public and private , as well as to understate or slight the achievements of individuals within that minority .

medium_antiracist_45565,"there is no class for this : a transracial adoptee ’ s critique on jordan montgomery ’ s “ culturally competent parenting : a test of web-based training for transracial foster and adoptive parents ” bree yoo-sun mcluen when george floyd was murdered in our home city of south minneapolis last may , it was one seed placed into my adoptive mother ’ s soul . our phone rang . in the background i could hear the voices of the 5 o ’ clock news reporters on kstp-5 , the local minneapolis outlet , urgently carrying out the latest messages . my mother sat on facetime on the couch in silence , staring at me . with tears in her eyes , we listened to the horror ; the chaos , the pain , and the terror that was soon to ensue . we sat for an unknown amount of time , weeping silently , staring at one another , the noise of the news behind her and my sleeping baby boy snoring next to me . “ i am so sorry . i can ’ t imagine what you must be going through as a mother right now , ” she said . this was the first time my mother acknowledged my pain as something she now shouldered as well . we have seen many black men fall since my son , black/occaneechi saponi native and korean , was born . shortly after trump became president a white man rolled his window down in afternoon traffic , and hurled an insult at my then 1.5 year old baby and his father . “ nigger ! ” he screamed , and peeled off . there were no tears from my mother , and from what i recall , hardly an acknowledgment . she had voted for trump for christian reasons , she said . and she became almost willfully silent about race matters for years thereafter . my adoptive parents are always quick to tell me that lutheran social services and korean social services provided a racial and cultural education course for adoptive parents . they ’ re quick to tell me how they felt faithfully called by their white jesus to adopt internationally . but , not nationally , my mother explained on the way to gymnastics practice one afternoon , because she felt ending up with an african-american child at that time was just “ too political. ” it seemed asian babies were just a safer bet for keeping quiet on the exploitative market of children for sale . montgomery , as all responsible researchers in the field do , noted the limitations of his study of parents ’ cultural receptivity due to convenience sampling . adoptive parents who were enrolled in support groups were pulled for the pre and post tests , study itself , and intervention , and subsequent follow up qualitative interviews if necessary . what about the vast majority of adoptive white parents whose ethnocentric , unchecked biases and privileged pride get in the way , and they take their children off the airplane and whisk them off into white suburban obscurity ? not only do they trudge tone-deaf through the required courses or trainings put on by social services agencies pre-adoption , but post-adoption services for adoptees themselves remains one of the lowest available social services and support systems in the entire field of social work itself . if the industry isn ’ t willing to follow up on its receipts of children , how could one expect it to do so for the white parents who , quite frankly , don ’ t get it ? the study is very much like transracial adoption . it is well-intentioned , but systemically rooted in injustice . montgomery speaks of cultural receptivity and a willingness and openness to learn for white adoptive parents . but while nearly anyone is capable of acting as a receptor or intervener of information , it implies or infers nothing on whether one is capable of responding . competency also may be problematic for attempting to educate adoptive white parents , because the social construct of race is neither a monolith nor is it ever finished unless eradicated . one may become competent for that present moment , but as we continue to witness in our present communities across the nation , race relations are indeed , not a thing of the past . montgomery may do well to turn his focus to cultural responsiveness . therefore , it doesn ’ t matter how many studies or trainings or seminars or classes are required for parents . when it comes down to the come down , doing life with one ’ s children of color and being present to witness the emergent assaults on their newly formed family is really the only way to truly understand . for most white parents , it ’ s their only accessibility to the oppression that continues to permeate our communities and our nation at large . and as expected before i read the findings , there is no significant change before or after the educational trainings are presented for most parents who adopt outside their race . “ we already knew a lot of this , ” they say . i truly doubt they can fully grasp the gravity of what this type of statement even means . it is like a slap in the face to their children . when i was young , the aryan nation took on a life of its own with their chapter down in rochester , mn . at this time , however , my mother promptly shut kstp-5 off when they reported this . “ don ’ t listen to that , bree . they ’ re not after you , ” insinuating they just wanted to physically hurt black people . as a second grader , i already had an awareness of my hyper sexualized image to white boys and men . i ’ d rather not specify how . i carried that with me for years , mostly internally and silently . but then two weeks ago , my initial gut and suspicions of what my mother wasn ’ t saying about the matter were confirmed . a 21 year old white supremacist sought out and murdered 6 of my asian-american sisters in atlanta . he then blamed it on their wrongful sexual temptation toward him due to their overlap of race and gender . three days after their murders , a 25 year old black male was murdered half a block from our home in chicago in broad daylight at the green line harlem stop . panicked because my son was visiting his father for the weekend , i called my dad . “ i don ’ t know who was shot . was it another asian hate crime ? ” “ bree . what happened in atlanta was an isolated incident . please don ’ t go down some rabbit hole of what is happening right now . the odds of that happening to begin with … so just don ’ t drive yourself crazy thinking about it. ” my dad is a youth minister and president of a non profit that trains and equips leaders of young people to serve their communities . he did not call to ask how we were doing , nor did he address it with his church , or use his reach in the church and faith communities to advocate for more visibility for people like his daughter and grandson , perhaps more vulnerable than ever in this global pandemic . and there ’ s something to be said about montgomery ’ s idea that parental trainings , support groups , or required continuing “ education ” on matters that impact their transracial children should be ongoing . a week after our all women ’ s development team at my internship ( a korean american social services agency ) were featured in npr , wttw , released our own e press statements with regard to atlanta and the aapi hate crimes on the rise , the derek chauvin ( officer who murdered floyd ) trial began . unlike my mother ’ s shock and agony at his death , there has been not a peep from her with regard to chauvin . i , however , find my own nuclear family , of carter and myself , more woefully and sorrowfully converged upon than ever . with regard to our people , our struggle , and our ongoing state of emergency and cyclical oppression , we stand as the only ones who continue to seek education and awareness as time passes . moreover , we seek to heal . montgomery may seek to educate white parents ’ on what they must know , but perhaps he must also desire to make them aware of what their children will inevitably feel at some point in their lives ; alone , disillusioned , unseen , worthless , dehumanized , vulnerable , oppressed , and tired . these are the pervasive themes of children of color from cradle to grave . white parents needn ’ t feel they can be placed on a graduation stage of cultural efficacy for knowing how to braid their black daughter ’ s hair and turn out decent edges with a toothbrush . how else will you keep her alive and proud to be so ? how much of your own privilege are you willing to address , and how even you adopting has continued to disenfranchise your child ’ s people of and family of origin ? my son and i are the lone members of our extended white family when it comes to a wholly committed desire to acknowledge there is a need for such education to continue . perhaps that is because our education is vital to our safety , our survival , and our hopes for more life beyond the visceral pain of racism in our own lives . meanwhile , my adoptive white parents carry on , having retired to a small lake house-like cabin 20 miles outside minneapolis , sitting on the dock , the soothing sound of the water drowning out the “ knowledge ” they received all those years ago .",medium_antiracist

reddit_antiracist_85110,"the history and social and political context of a word is what makes it racist . 

 there are no pejoratives for white people that are the equivalent of the n - word is for black people . a racial slur is designed to demean someone for their ethnicity / race . calling someone the n - word is meant to ' put them in their place ' , remind them that they belong to a group considered inferior . 

 whites were never considered inferior for being white . there is no history of white people being enslaved , persecuted , and oppressed for being white . they have been and are still at the top of the racial hierarchy . people aspired to whiteness . so there 's no way to demean a white person for being white when whiteness is still considered positive , even superior . 

 not all black americans agree with using the n - word . they 're not a monolith .   some use it in order to reclaim the word , defang it . but not all of them think the word is worth reclaiming . audre lorde once wrote that "" the master 's tools will never dismantle the master 's house "" . but i 'm not black , so it 's not my place to go around telling black people what they can and ca n't say .",reddit_antiracist

medium_antiracist_31351,"evolve . ( this post is directed to my fellow white people . ) i understand how it feels . we constantly hear about race . we constantly get the knot in our stomachs because we “ don ’ t treat people differently based on race ” and no one we personally know does either . we feel like “ they are always making it about race. ” we feel like “ they are the ones being divisive ” . what this means to me is that those who feel these things are aware enough to recognize their own prejudices and not let them affect others . maybe i ’ m projecting , but that ’ s how i felt . i know i have prejudices and when they sneak into my mind i tell myself no . that is a preconceived notion based on something i experienced when i was younger and it stuck around in my unconscious . i stop to reflect on where my prejudices come from and then make a conscious effort to give whomever the benefit of the doubt . this is step one . i don ’ t get a cookie for this and neither do you . this is the duty of a civilized , intelligent , socially aware human being . step two is to recognize we ’ re reacting to what we consider a personal condemnation . this is where we default to “ but not all ______ ” . stay with me here . i ’ m starting to lose some of you to the “ but ” statements . it is true that not all ____ do whatever you ’ re thinking . not all cops . not all white people . not all men . this isn ’ t the point . when we hear “ that shirt/saying/picture/headline/insert whatever it is here is racist ” , it is our duty as civilized , intelligent , socially aware human beings to understand why someone feels that way . once we suppress the initial urge to defend and actually understand why someone else is hurt by whatever it is , then you are within your rights to agree or disagree . however , this is where it gets tricky . if you disagree , you have no right whatsoever to force someone else to agree with you . this is where the concept of respect comes in . respect has two parts : 1 ) agree to disagree ; 2 ) do not insist on displaying/saying/wearing/insert appropriate verb here whatever it is that hurts another person . yes , it is your right to do as you wish and it is not against any law to offend someone . it ’ s about being respectful of another person . i really want to stay away from analogies in this post but sometimes it ’ s necessary . if you would chide your child from commenting about someone ’ s scar across their face , regardless of how true the comment is , you are teaching your child not to draw attention to what ’ s different about a person and that commenting on that difference may hurt their feelings or bring back painful memories . not using a word or symbol is the same thing . step three : realize that our reaction is “ but it ’ s everything ” is false . it ’ s not everything . we are only being made aware that what we consider innocuous may not be to others . for instance : i was having a conversation with someone younger who was horrified that another person used the term afro-american . i asked if the person who said it was older than 40 and he was . i explained that many of us who are over 40 were taught to say afro-american instead of negro . when we are taught what to say as a child , it ’ s difficult to change the habit and we need to be reminded of how language has changed . i ’ m willing to bet the person who said it meant no disrespect . however , society has evolved to recognize terms like “ afro-american ” , “ oriental ” , and “ american indian ” are not accurate labels for anyone or anything . it doesn ’ t matter that you feel that another person shouldn ’ t be upset over a label . another analogy : you don ’ t force an adult to eat asparagus if they say they don ’ t like it because you do . you shrug , think them a little odd , and then chow down on the extra that someone didn ’ t want . step four : figure out why we ’ re so angry . we get angry about so many things . i personally think that it ’ s because we ’ re all so stressed . being respectful takes work . it means keeping up with what ’ s happening in our world . it means being aware of where oppositions come from . it means facing ugly realities like finding out that “ gypped ” is derogatory to an entire culture , that “ indian giver ” is not that a person wants back something they gave away , and that the original line wasn ’ t “ catch a tiger by its toe ” . being respectful means to be aware of how your words and actions affect others and we ’ re so stressed as it is . but it ’ s a stress we can actually fix ! i swear . keep reading . in addition to the quoted statements in the first paragraph , there is another big one i hear from my fellow white people : “ i ’ m so tired of it. ” the truth of the matter is that we are the ones who are fueling the racial fires . how ? we ’ re doing this by not listening . we encourage divisiveness by being dismissive . i ’ ve written before that if people have to constantly repeat themselves , they will eventually get angry enough to yell and throw something against the wall . ( if you ’ ve never gotten to this point , congratulations and teach me your ways ! ) i ’ ve sat at a table and listened to complaints about a how a university cultural advocacy group requires its members to be of that specific culture . others are welcomed to join in their functions but the actual governing students need to be of that culture . i heard complaints that the policy is divisive . i don ’ t believe it is . i wouldn ’ t want to go to a women ’ s group and have the discussions led by men ; i ’ d be thrilled to have men show their support at functions . i wouldn ’ t want to attend a support group led by someone who has never experienced the trauma or illness being supported ; i ’ d love for someone lucky enough not to have lived through a specific trauma or illness come to educate themselves at an open event . an argument could be made against excluding members with no personal experiences… . but i ’ ve yet to hear a solid one . there are exceptions to everything . arguing with “ what about ______ ? ” isn ’ t helpful . i ’ m positive that your specific exception is relevant , valid , and something we should be aware of . please be aware that “ what about_____ ” is still being dismissive . however , if your question is genuine and not meant to be a challenge , be sure your tone of voice reflects that and , if you are on the internet , make sure to add a disclaimer because your tone could be misinterpreted . why am i suggesting this course of action ? why should you do a self-check on all this racism talk ? why shouldn ’ t you ? seriously . why shouldn ’ t you ? go back up to that first paragraph . i understand . i won ’ t make you guess why i understand . i used to feel all of this . i used to argue with “ but not all white people ” . i used to argue with “ but not all cops ” . i still feel that not all white people and not all cops are being harmful to others . the difference is that i ’ ve realized it is not a valid argument . i ’ ve stopped taking the declaration of racism as an attack against me personally . * other than its very existence , the only thing that angers me about racism/discrimination/prejudice * * is that there are people who still roll their eyes about it rather than actively doing something to abolish this hatred . it ’ s uncomfortable to realize when we ’ re at fault . it ’ s hard to hear we ’ re wrong . it ’ s hard to do the right thing . we have to step up and change our behavior . requests : if you plan to argue with insults , i assume you do not have a leg to stand on , so please have a seat . please do not argue about “ political correctness ” ; i ’ m convinced it is synonymous with “ i can ’ t be bothered to be respectful ” . thank you . * to poc reading this , i ’ m aware that i benefit from a racist system ; i am working on bring awareness to others and doing my best to check my privilege . i screw up , but i try . * * racism , discrimination , and prejudices are all different but intertwined things . example : white people do not experience racism , but we have been victims of prejudice . go ahead and research it .",medium_antiracist
